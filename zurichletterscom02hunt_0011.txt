INTRODUCTION.

ΟΝ the accession of Queen Mary to the throne of En-
gland‚ A.D. 1553, she proceeded with much severity against the
favourers of the Reforinatiom of whom upwards of a thou-
sand persons, according to bishop Burnet¹, sought refuge
among the protestant churches on the continent. Many ot'
them ⁴settled at Zurich, where “they were entertained both
by the xnagist1·ates² and the niinisters‚ Bullinger„ Gualter,
Weidner, Simler, Lavater, Gesner, and all the rest of that
body, with a tenderness and affection that engaged them to
the end of their lives to make the greatest acknowledgments
possible for it.” After their return home, upon queen Eliza-
beth's coming to the crown‚ A. D. 1558, they maintained a
close correspondence with their late hosts; and their letters, to-
gether with those of Bullinger, have long been regarded among
the principal objects of interest in the Zurich archives.

Oopies of these letters, or at least of a portion of them,
were obtained by Bishop Burnet and Strypffl both of whom
have made frequent reference to them in their respective works.
A few of the letters7 chiefly those of Jewel, are printetL
though very inaccurately, in the Histoi-ical Records appended
to Bul-net„ who lias also introduced occasional abstracts into
the body of liis history. The like may bc said of Strype.

five deans, four archdeacons, and fifty-seven doctors in ‹livinity und
prcachcrs, arc given by Strypc, Life of Cranmcr, 1. 441).

offered, by Bullinger, to supply thc exiles with such a quantity of
broad-corn and wine, as should scrvc to sustain thirteen or fourtccn
peoplc; but they with thanks refused it. Cranmcr, 1. 509.
