though to a sar less cxtent; so that the collection, as a
whole. may bc considered as being now for the first time
presented to the public.

An account ‘of the original autographs is given by Bur-
net‘„ who saw them as he passed through Zur-ich, Α. D. 1685.
He says. ‘· Among the archives of the dean and chapter
there is a vast collection of letters written either to Bullinger
ιη· hy him: they are bound up, and make a great many
volumes in soli03 and out of these no doubt but one might
discover a great many particulars relating to the history of
the Reformation. For as Bullinger lived long‚ so he was
much esteemed. He procured a very kind reception to be
given to some of our English exiles in queen Mary's reign;
in particular to Sandys⁷ afterwards archbishop of York‚ to
Horu, afterwards bishop of Winchcster, and to J ewel‚ bishop
of Salisbury. He gave them ledgings in the close, and used
them with all possible kindness: and as they presented some
silver cups² to the college with an inscription acknowledging
the kind reception they had found there, which I saw3 so
they continued to keep a constant correspondence with Bul-
lingcr after the happy establishment of the Reformation under
queen Elizabetln of which I read almost a whole volume
while I was there.”

A large portion of the letters here referred to are now
before the reader, namely, those written during a period of
about twenty-one years from the accession of queen Elizabeth.
To them is added a letter of later date, written in 1590, by
that monarch to the thirteen Swiss Cantons; as are also a
few letters from Peter Martyr, Bulhnger, and Gualter, in
rcply to some of those of our own reformers above mentioned.
