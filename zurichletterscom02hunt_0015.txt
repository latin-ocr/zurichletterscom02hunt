These last contain the sentiments of these eminent divines
upon the questions by which the Church of England was
agitated at that period.

The copies from which the present collection is printed
and the translation made, were procured from Zur-ich, for
his own use, by the Rev, John Hunter, of Bath; who, on
hearing of the formation of the Parker Society, with unso-
licited kindness and liberality immediately placed them at its
disposal. The accur-acy of their collation with the original
autographs is attested by M. de Meyer de Knonau, the
keeper of the archives, to whose courtesy the Editor is con-

century.” The letters in the city libi-ary are dispersed through
nine volumes, numbered, 38, 39, 42, 46, 56, 57, 60, 61, 62,
and are in the manuscript class F. They are also bound in
parchment, as the volumes in the archiveS, to which they
bear a great resemblance. Almost all these letters are origi—
nal, and with the exception of those of Richard Cox, F.
Bedfonl, and the duke of Norfolk, who have only added their
