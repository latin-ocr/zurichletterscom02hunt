XCV1.] RICHARD HILLES TO HENRY BULLINGER. 241

LETTER XCVI.

 

RICHARD HILLES TO HENRY BULLINGER.

Dated at Loxnox, July 27, 1571.

Muen health in the Lord. Ι wrote a letter to you, very
reverend Sir, on the 8th of March, which my son Barnabas,
as he afterwards informed me, transmitted to you by Christopher
Frosehover, at the last Frankfort fair. You have received it,
I hope, before this time3 and would learn from it that your
last copious letter of the month of August in the past year
has long since reached me. I have only, however, received
this day your most gratifying letter from Zurich, of the 25th
of February in this present year, together with your three
letters addressed to the reverend the bishops of Y ork, Ely,
and Salisbury; and also the three copies in manuscript, of
which you write in the letter above mentioned3 all of which
I will take care shall be faithfully delivered to the bishops to
whom you have directed them. I certainly much wonder
where they have been so long delayed in their journey: but
Ι am very glad to have received them even now; and I have
to thank you also for your present of a book printed in
German, entitled, A promised Answer to the Testament of
John Brentius, διο. Of this Ι have received two copies,
besides five books printed in Latin, and three letters, viz.
one to the bishop of London, another to the bishop of
Durham, and the third to Henry Butler, together with the
three manuscript copies above-mentioned; which letters, as
well as all the aforesaid seven printed books, I will take carc
shall be delivered as soon as possible, to the persons to whom
in your letter you desired them to be sent³ ......... This
cloth I make you a present of ς and I pray God that you may
long enjoy it, though it is not very likely that you will: for
Jerome says most truly, quoting some philosopher or poet,
The young may die soon, but the old cannot live long.

[³ A paragraph respecting some eloth that Bullinger had bospokon,

is here omitted. It is given in the original letter at the end of this
volume]
