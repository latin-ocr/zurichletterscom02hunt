That labour of yours, of which you inform me, in replying
to the whole of that impudent popish bull which the Roman
antichrist 1135 vomited forth against our most serene queen. will
be, without doubt, very greatly approved by the three bishops
afore-mentioned, to whom you 11319 59111- 111059 three copies;
and if they think it for the good of the kingdom, and that it
will be agreeable to her most serene highness, they will publish
it. Ι 3111 much grieved at your so humbly entreating me
to take in good part your writing to 1119, and that you ask my
pardon for so freely employing my services; for you may
always employ them most freely as long as I live.

By the blessing of God. before the dissolution or ending
of the Parliament held at- VVestminster, the above-mentioned
Hem-y Butler 1135 here with his master. Parkhurst, bishop of
Norwich‚ and was 3111110051)- expecting a letter from his mother:
for, as he then told me, he had not heard from her since his
arrival in England. Master doctor Mont‚ however, informed
him in my house, that 3 packet of letters had been left at his
house in Strasburgh‚ in which he thought there were some
addressed to this Henry Butler.

In the month of June now last past, the very learned
divine David Whitehead, 11110 was an exile in queen Mary's
time for the profession of orthodox doctrine, departed happily
in the Lord. He also lived about seven years a widower,
as you write me word is now your own case3 but very lately,
before the middle of this year. he married 3, young widow
when he was himself about eighty. Master Cole too, 11110 was
also at that period an exile in Germany for preaching the
gospel, died about the same time of the quinsey, on the day
aster he was taken ill. The archdeacon of Essex‚ in the
diocese of London, who 1135 preferred a. month or 1110 before
his death to the deanery of Salisbury‚ died here at London,
on the same day⁷ as is reported, or 011 1119 day preceding that
on which he had determined to go from London to Salisbury
to receive induction‚ attended by many friends and domestics.

Thus from a slight and slender thread all human things depend,
And those which seem the strongest 11011 may soonest have an endl.
