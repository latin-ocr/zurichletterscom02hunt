difficulty, and the other without bloodshed. Every thing turned
out so unexpectedly as it were from above, that it seemed
as though the Lord of hosts and of might had undertaken from
his heaven the cause of his gospel, and had fought, as it were,
with his own hands. The winds from heaven brought us in,
as if with spontaneous gales, the arms, treasures, and ships of
the one, while the repert that the royal army was advancing,
dismayed and scattered the soldier-s, baggage, and military stores
of the other. Thus the one party were unconquered till they
were completely routed; the others were manifestly conquered
before they had made any progress, There were only two noble-
men¹‚ and those of no influence or reputation3 men, to say the
least of them, of the most worthless character, and of the old

London 1840, p. xw. Xix. “ The earls, after refusing to obey the queen’s
commands to repair to her presence, committed themselves irrevocably,
by entering Diu-ham in arms 011 the 14th November. For a short period
they acted with vigour, and proceedcd rapidly to Ripon‚ lVetherby, and
Tadcaster, and finally they assembled on Clifford Moor. The queen of
Scots was suddenly removed from T utbury to Coventry, and the earls
hesitated what course to pursue. The earl of Sussex, with Sadler ancl
Hunsdon, felt insecure in York, which however they dui-st not leave on
account of their inferiority in cavalry. They could not act on the offen-
sive, as their levies came slowly in; and they were reduced to the
mortifying alternative of keeping a watchful eye on the movements of
the rebels, The earl of Sussex, (now lieutenant general of the army in
the north‚) directed Sir Georgo Bowes, in the event of their proceeding·
southwards, to join him immediately with the northern horsemen.

“ From whatever cause—whether from ‘mistrusting themselves’,
according to IIollinshed 3 from ‘disagreement amongst themselves’,
according to lady Northumberland ,· or, more probably, from pei-ceiving
that no response was made to their movements by the great body of tlu-
[Roman] Catholics of England,—-the rebels suddenly retreated and re-
turned to the county of Durham; where, instead of pursuing vigorous
mensures to restore their ‘moral force', and increase their numbers,
they wasted their time and strength iu laying siege to Barnard castlc ;
during whose prolonged and gallant resistancv, the army of the south,
commanded by the lords WVarwick und Clinton, arrived at Doni-asten
when Sussex, thus powerfully supported, advanced rapidly toward thc
county of Durham 3 audon his approach the earls, without waiting for an
att-auk, suddenly dismissed their infantry, and flying with tlicir cavalry
towards Ilexluun, afterwards took refuge in Scotland.
