xcvl11.] To HENRY BULLINGER. 249

in sagacity and sense, and entirely ignorant and unknown,
who, since they do not yet pereeive the ehureh to square with
their wishes, or rather vanities, and that so far from agrecing
with their sollies, the wind is rather directly contrary, for this
cause some of them desert their posts, and hide themselves in
idleness and obscurity; others, shaping out sor themselves
their own barks, call together conventicles, elect their own
bishOPS, and holding synods one with another, frame and
devise their own laws for themselves. They reject preaehing,
despise communion, would have all churches destroyed, as
having been formerly dedicated to popei-y, nor are they con-
tent with merely deriding our ministers, but regard the office
itself as not worth a straw. And thus, as far as lieth in them,
they are too rashly and precipitatcly accessory to the wretched
shipwreck of our church, and are doubtless retarding not a

the mean time, wonderfully tossed about by I know not what
waves of error, and miserably borne along, I know not whither,
on the various gales of vanity, are reduced to the most absurd
ravings of opinion. They therefore cut themselves off, as they
say, from us; or rather, like Theudas, they depart with their

somewhat against them, so that they cannot directly reaeh the
point they aim at, rcfuse to reservo themselves for a more
favourable breeze, but leaping out of the ship, rush headlong
into the sea and are drowned. But here it is wonderful how
fit an instrument, as they think, the adversaries of our
religion have laid hold of for dishonouring the gospel. They
whisper in the queen's ears, that this is the fruit of our gospel
now coming to matur-ity3 that this is the only harvest of our
doctrine to be expected, so that, unless her pious heart had
been altogether inflamed with the love of the truth, it would long
since have been cooled by their aspersions. Yon see Ι have
endeavoured, my excellent Bullinger, as bricfly as I could, to
make you perceive, as it were at one glance, the whole state
of our affairs, and the aspect of tho government, and the
entire condition of the ehureh.

wearied with wars, has at length allowed herself a little
