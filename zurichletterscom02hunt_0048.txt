and sound, as it is certain from experience, so it is true in
the relation of it3 yet as being of rare occurrence, will almost
be incredible in the hearing. For both in the commetiens in
Franco, and the contests in Scotlaud, and moreover with the
secret hatred of Spain, none of which could ever be overeome
by any slight means or ordinary exertions, our Elizabeth, the
sole nurse (as it were) of these affairs, and solely for the sake
of the gospel, has preserved the friends of godliness, who
would otherwise doubtless have been destroyed long since, free
from harm. But observe that ancient and most convenient,
and in a manner the leading stratagem of the papists, which is
now both rendered familiar to us by daily experience, and
peculiar to themselves by long use and possession. They
besiege the tender srame of the most noble virgin Elizabeth
with almost endless attacks, and most studiously endeavour to
compass her death, both by poison, and violence, and witch-
craft, and treason, and all other means of that kind which
could ever be imagined, and which it is horrible even to relate.
Hitherto however, as God has had for his gospel a faithful

long since, a doctor of laws, of some learning, such an one, I
imagine, as those among the Jews who menaced Christ with
death: his name is Story, a man, as it were, born for cruelty,
a most raging persecutor¹ in the Marian times, to whom it was

character may be judged of from the following language, addressed to
Philpot, and recorded by Foxe: “vveil, Sir, you are like to go after
your fathers, Latimer the sophister, and Ridley, who had nothing to
allege for himself but that he had learned his heresy of Cranmer. then
Ι came to him with a poor bachelor of arts, he trembled as though he
had had the palsy3 as these heretics have always some token of sear
