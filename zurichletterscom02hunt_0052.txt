merchants. After he had entered the ship, and was prying
about in every corner, and had just gone down into the interior
of the vessel, they suddenly closed the hatehes, and with their
sails set are carried by a prosperous and safe breeze into
England. And here, if in addition to all the ships of the
Turkish empire laden with treasure even the whole Venetia-n
fleet with all its wealth had met them, and been offered to
them on their way, I well know that they would not have
exchanged this merchandize and worthless lading of their little
vessel for all those treasures. And so at length he was brought·
to London, amidst the great congratulations of the people,
awaiting him on his return3 and shortly after being convicted
of treason, hung¹ and quartered, was made an ill-savoured
martyr of the Roman church, and em·olled in the popish
catalogue of saints, next to Felton, who affixed the pope”s
bull to the palace-gates of the bishop of London,

I have moreover transmitted to you, my Bullinger, by this
carrier ten crowns, not so much by way of an honourable, or
at least an honorary present, as a token, such as it is, of my
regard towards you. The whole of this sum I desire to be
expended upon a public entertainment in your common hall,
devoted to the remembrance of me, though without a sacrifice.

Farewell all of you, and live happy. Ι desire you would
so think of me, just as you are accustomed to regard one who
for your sake would willingly plan any thing by his advice, or
aeeomplish it by his assistance, or embraee it 111 1115 thoughts,
or lastly, promote it by his infiuence. May Christ J esus
preserve the church which he has redeemed by his precious
blood, disappoint the designs of all her adversaries, frustrate
their attempts, and break their power! Farewell, most loving
Bullinger, and live in him who is the author of life. London,
Aug. 8, 1571.

Wholly yours,

ROBERT WINTON.
