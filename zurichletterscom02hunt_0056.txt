here at Norwich among the foreigners; nor are they even
yet reconciled‚ though there is some hope that things will be
on a better footing and more peaceable in future. You

nothing of expence, during the whole time3 and yet these
refractory people will not give up a single point. I have always
treated them with the greatest mildness and consideration,
though of late a little harshly, contrary to my nature. But
what could you do? If we cannot succeed in one way, we must
try another. Three³ of their preachers, ambitious and aspiring
men, occasioned and continued all this disturbance. The
whole congregation was very near being broken up. Their

was supplied with three ministers named Anthonius, Theophilus and
