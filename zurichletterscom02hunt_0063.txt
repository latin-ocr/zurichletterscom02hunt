XCIX] TO HENRY BULLINGER. 257

nobles are sometimes quari-elling with each other, not on
account of religion, to which all parties are favourable, but
for the custody of the king, which is their chief object.
The queen of Scotland is still detained in England. The
archbishop of St Andrew's·¹, the author of many disturbances
in Scotland‚ was hung 00 a gibbet last May.

The marquis of Northampton⁵ (the brother of queen
Catharine, the last wife of Henry the eighth‚ and my most
gentle mistress, whom I attended as chaplain twenty-three
years since‚) died about the beginning of August. WVhen l
was in London‚ he married a very beautiful German girl, who
remained in the queen's court aster the departure of the mar-
grave of Baden and Gecilia⁶ his wife from England. 0111·

[⁴ James Hamilton, the natural son of dames, first Earl of Arrun.
Hc was one of the Queen of Scots’ privy eouncil, and performed 1110
ceremony of ehristening her son. He was 111 the castle of Dumbarton
when that fortrcss was taken by surprise, from whence he was carried to
Stirling, where 011 April lst, 1570, hc was hanged 011 a live trec, which
gave occasion to the following lines:

“Vive diu, felix arbor, semperque virete

Frondibus, ut nobis talia poma feras?
He was put 10 death because he was strongly suspected of being eon-
cerned in the death of the regent Murray, by whom he had been (10-
clar-ed a traitor. Beatson’s Politieal Index. Cartc however says (in
his History of England) that he was condemned, not for Darnley’s 01·
Murray’s murder, with which they endeavoured to blacken him, though
innocent, but for rebellion against the priuee of scotland in adhering
to his mother ; and that the sentence was the effect of Lenox's personal
eumity to the house of Hamilton.]

ampton 15473 attainted 1554, when his honours became forfeited:
