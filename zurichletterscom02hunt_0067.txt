during my residence in London, I had not been accustomed
to riding on horseback3) on which account Ι was forced to
rest ten days in the midst of my journey. At length on
the l7th of August I arrived at Oawood² (where Ι have
a palace on the banks of the Ouse, about seven miles from
the city,) my fever, as the event proved, not being sufficiently
cu1·ed; for I was seized on the second of September following
with another very severe and acute fover, which weakened me
to such an excess, that not only my physicians and friends
despaired of my recovery, but I myself also received the
sentence of death in myself. But the Lord, who killeth and
maketh alive, restored me at length after six months to my
former health, the violence of the disorder gradually de-
ereasing, yet so as I was not able to leave my chamber
the whole winter. Since then Ι have laboured to the ut—
most of my power, and still continue to do, in the visitation
of my province and diocese, and in getting rid of those
remaining superstitions³ which have maintained their place
more firmly in this part of the country, suffering as it does

[² This place was the residence of the archbishops of York, having
been given by king Athelstan to qulstam the fifteeuth arehbishop ,· and
where they had a magnificent palace, or eastle, in which several of thc
prelatos lived and died, and in which cardinal W olsey was arrested
by the carl of Northumberland on a charge of tieason, in the reign
of Hem-y VIII. This castlc was dismantlcd, and in part demolished,
at the conclusion of the parliamentary war; since which time, being
abandoned by the archbishops, it has remained iu a state of gradual
dilapidation, and has nearly fallen into ruin. Lcwis's Topogr. Dion]

[³ In his letter wrote to the secret-ary, August 29 [1570] he sayna,
“they keep holidays and fasts abrogated,· they offer money, eggs, &ta at*
the burial of their dead ,⁰ they pray beads, Kc. so as this seems to be as it
were another cliurch, rather than a member of the 1·est.” Strypv.
Grindal, 2453. Other popish eustoms then prevalent in the north were,
the frequent use and veneration of crosses, month's minds, obits :md
anniversaries, the chief intent whereof was praying for the ‹lcud3 the su-
perstitious used in going the bounds of the parishcs; lnorris-tlslllrcl's and
minstrels coming into the church in service-time, to the ‹listnrbanee os
God’s worship3 putting the consecrated bread into the receivcr's mouth,
as among the papists the priest did the wafer; orossius-1 and broathing
upon the elements in the celebration of the Lord’s supper and clevation ;
oil, tapers, and spittle in the other sacrament of baptism ; pauses and iun-1·-
missions in reading the services of the clun-clu pra-vinur Avo Marias :iwl
Pater-nosters upon beads; setting up candles in the churches tu the
Vix-gin Mary on Candlemasday, and the like. Strype, Grindal, 25] .]
