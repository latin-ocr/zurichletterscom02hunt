than Ι expected, as far as external conformity is concerned:
the reason is, that they have been sufficiently distressed,
and therefore humbled, by those calamities which are always
the concomitante of civil war. I wish I had found them

usual at each of the Frankfort fairs. Matters here are at
present, through the great mercy of God, tolerably quiet: how-
ever, at the end of last summer, no one suspecting anything
of the kind, we were in the greatest danger, as you may pro-
bably conjecture from a document inclosed in this letter, and
both published in our language in the form of a letter,
and translated into Latin. The daughter of the Guises,
who calls herself the queen of Scotland, is now consigned
to closer custody2. Thomas duke of Norfolk was brought
