2 62 ARCHBISHOP GRINDAL [LET.

Scotland has been sorely distressed the whole of this
year with intestine commotions. For after the death of the
regent J ames, the grandfather¹ of the young king was elected
in his room. About a year ago he made an unexpected
attempt upon the well fortified castle of Dumbarton at the
mouth of the Glyde, which he took in the night—time by
means of scaling ladders, having first killed the sentinels; and
he compelled the archbishop of St Andrew's‚ whom he found
there, and who was a natural brother of the duke of Ha-
milton, to put an end to his life by lianging². In revenge
tfor this, about the beginning of last May, the Hamiltons
with three hundred horse entered by night the town of Stirling,
and there put to death on the spot the new regent³, whom
they seized in his chamber. The earl of Mai-⁴ was chosen
by the king's party in his 1·oom; a good man, but not pos-
sessing much influence. The Scots therefore, divided into
many factions as well public as private, are attacking each
other with mutual violence. The queen's party have seized
upon the town and castle of Edinburgh. The king's adherents
have fortified the neighbouring harbour of Leith, and strength-
ened it with a garrison. The regent J ames had given the
command of the castle of Edinburgh to one Kirkaldy⁵‚ as

[³ Lord Burghley gives, in a letter to Thomas Smith, dated
Sept. ssth, 1574, the following account of his death: “On monday
last, two hundred and forty horsemen‚ a hundred footenien, all of the
castle of Edmborough, stole to Sterling townc, which they entered
quietly, and tooke the regente and all the lords of his present, in their
beds, and when they were carrying them away, their soldyers fell to
spoyle, and a power of the castle of Styrling issuing out rescued
them all, and slew their takers3 but in this fight the regent was hurt,
and by some advertisements I hear that he is dead.'' MS. Cott. Calig. c.
111. 227. In another letter from Burghley to the earl of Shrewsbury,
dated Sept. 13, he writes, “ It is true that the erle of LenOX, late regent,
was slain after that he was taken, by commandment of Claud Hamilton,
and he that killed hym named Calder, who hath confessed it.'']'

[4 “ The erle of Mari· is confirmed regent by parlement at δίει-11ης,
whereto the erles of Argile, Eglinton, Cassels, and Crawford, with the
'lords Boyd and St. Colme, have sworne and subscribed.” Burghley to
lord Shrewsbury, Sept. 13, as above]

afterwards cxecuted]
