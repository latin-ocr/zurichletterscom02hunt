264 BISIIOP SANDYS [LET.

LETTER CI.

BISHOP SANDYS TO HENRY BULLINGER.

Dated at Lonnox, Feb. 17, 1572.

HEALTH in Christ. That Ι have not replied, my very
dear brother, and most reverend master, to your frequent
letters, I would have you ascribe, not so much to my want
of gratitude, as to most troublesome hinderances of various
kinds. For to pass over many other things which have pre—
vented this intercourse of regard and accustomed corre-
spondence, the first and most affiictive is this, the extreme
violence and extent of my late attack of illness, by which the
Lord exercised me so painfully and for 50 long a time, that
J had altogether given up thinking upon these matters. To
this must be added a constant accession of business, which
the station in which I am now placed daily occasions me, and
by which I am almost so overwhelmed, that I have no
opportunity either for personal relaxation or correspondence
with others. In fine, even if sufficient time and leisure were
afforded, such is the present unsettled state of affairs, that
nothing can be transmitted from us to you; especially since
there is so close a blockade both by land and sea, that it is
not safe to send letters.

l received your last letter at the end of December, and
when I had read it, endeavoured, as diligently as I could, to
comply with your request. In recommending your grandson¹
and those other friends of yours to the bishop of N orwich,

[l Rodolph Zuinglius, whose father married Bullinger's daughter.
He came over to England with a son of Rodolph Gualter, by whom
they were recommendcd to bishop Parkhurst. With him they were
in the beginning of December at Ludham, where, says Sti-ype, he treated
them with oysters, which the young men wondered to 566 him eat.
But however young Gualter ventured at last upon them ,· for so the
bishop mcrrily wrote to his father: but as for Zuinglius, as the bishop
went on, he dared not cum vivis animalibus conyredi. Strype, Annals,
11. i. 336]
