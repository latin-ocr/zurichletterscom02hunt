you lighted upon the very man who, while 116 had the greatest
desire to serve you, yet possessed at the sanie time no means
whatever of doing so. For-² having lately entrusted with too
great confidence the management of his affairs to 111611 of
dishonest character, it has come to pass by their means that
he is so overwhelmed with debt, as to be unable to extricato

remembranee of your kindness, and partly because Ι considered
I should be acting acceptably to God, and especially to yourself,
I took upon myself the charge of assisting 11161113. l speedily

to place them in different colleges, lest their frequent inter-

queen. Which was the reason he was sain to absent froin Non-widi, and
live more privately at Ludham, a country seat belonging 10 1116 566.
