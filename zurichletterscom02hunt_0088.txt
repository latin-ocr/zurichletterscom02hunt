BISHOP COX TO HENRY BULLINGER.
Dated at LONDON, ELY HousE, June 6, 1572.

Mucii health in Christ, my brother. Your letter, which
was on many accounts most gratifying to me, and which you
state to have been written on the 12th of March, came to
hand about the end of May3 from which Ι understand that
you have not yet received those books printed in this country,
which you most learnedly and piously composed against the
pope’s bull. I sent, however, to the autumn fair at Frankfort
both a letter and four books, together with a little money for
the use of yourself and our friend J ulius. The money I
hear arrived safe; but I am told that the letter and books
are still loitering on the road. I therefore again send you a
few copies for you to make use of, in case you should not
receive the others.

As to the news about which you write, may the great and
good God turn all things to our good aud the glory of his
name! It is a great satisfaction to us that your churches
are at peace, and not without an accession of other churches to
the sincere profession of the christian religion. then Ι have
an opportunity of obtaining an audience from the queen's
inajesty, I will not forget to acquaint her with how great
zea] and good will you espouse her cause. She was exceed·
