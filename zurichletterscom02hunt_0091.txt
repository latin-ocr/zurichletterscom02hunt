Hitherto the pope has been antichrist. Should it please (iod
to raise up another, even the Tecrk, it is only what our sins
deserve. Our own affairs are in this condition. The duke
of Norfolk³, who most wickedly contrived a plot against
our queen, has met with the punishment hc deserved. Mary.
the late queen of Scots, is publicly declarcd the enemy of 0111·
kingdom and queen, and is strictly kept in custody. She was
meditating indeed both the destruction of our kingdom, the
death of our queen, and the overthrow of our religion, by all
possible means.

Respecting your grandson Zuinglius⁴ I had rather say
little, than much with grief. The affairs of mankind are
not governed by our will, but by divine providence. His con—

endure, and not find fault with that which cannot be avoided.
May the Lord J esus Christ, my esteemed brother, long, very
long preserve you to us in safety l London. From my lions(¹
in Holborn, June 6, 1572.

The books must be sent, if possible, by another eonveyaiwe
