270 RICHARD HILLEs [LET.

LETTER CI V.

RICHARD HILLES TO HENRY BULLINGER.

Dated at Loxnox, July 10, 1572.

Mucn health. In March last I sent my letter, dated on
the leth of the preceding February, to my son Barnabas,
that it might be delivered to the care of Christopher Fros-
chover at the Frankfort spring fair3 and I hope you have
received it from him. At the same time I received two very
long and friendly letters from you, the first written on the 20th
of December, and the other on the 12tl1 of last March, toge-
ther with a slip of paper inclosed in them, in which you
write me word what you have heard from Venice respecting
the defeat¹ of the Turks, and what you can learn rc-
specting the state of Germany and the cessation of the,
persecution, &cn For these letters and this intelligence J
sincerely thank you.

At. the time of the same fair I received from you some
other letters to certain of our bishops, which I gave in charge
with all diligence to Rodolph Gualter and Henry Butler, who
had other matters of their own to transact with the bishops,
(who are now engaged at the public assembly, which we call
the 2Parliament,) that they might deliver them to each, as
they write me word they have done, except the one which
you wrote to Jewel, bishop of Salisbury, which, as he is
dead, I handed over, according to your desire, to Parkhurst,
bishop of Norwich. But what do you think? How it has
happened, Ι know n0t; but neither then, nor at any time
since, have Ι received the books you mention, written con-
cerning Exhortation, neither in Latin, nor in German3 so
that Ι know not what answer to make respecting them. I
have however to thank you in the mean time for those
