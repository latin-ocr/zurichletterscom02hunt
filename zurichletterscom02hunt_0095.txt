σιν] 'ro HENRY BULmNGnR. 271

two copies in German, and one in Latin, which you or-
dered to be sent to me here. Moreover, the above-named
Rodolph and Henry have no certain intelligence respectingg
those books. I have received, however, the books published iu
Latin by Rodolph's father, together with those which the
said persons have distributed to those to whom Rodolph's fa-

Gerson, to repay to you. My son added, moreover, that he
paid over to the said Froschover at the same time ten pieces

bishop of Ely had before placed here to be paid to the said
Julius. As to your writing me word to this effect, “that it

ease, because you do not mention whether my son Barnabas,
who was present at that Frankfort fair, paid over those twenty·
seven dollars to Froschover.

Your grandson⁴ Zuinglius departed from this most corrupt
generation to God, here at London, in June last, and is added
to the assembly of the saints, among whom he sings praises
to G-od his Redeemer. But Rodolph Gualter⁶, together with
Henry Butler, are now returned to Cambridge, whence they
came hither at the opening of parliament with the bishop of
Norwich, whom l hear to be the especial patron of Henry
Butler; to whose mother or friends l will thank you to write,
to say that he has received no remittances from them since h(-
