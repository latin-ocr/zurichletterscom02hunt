most serene queen of England, Franco, and Ireland, and the
king of France, a solemn engagement having been entered into
by both parties on Sunday tho 15t11 of June·¹ last iu the
cathedral church of St Peter in westminster.

On the 251211 of June I first received your letter, dated
Zurich, October 1st, 1571, and sent by Frederick Conders, a
gentleman whom you commended to me. And if l ean serve
him in any thing, without inconvenience or trouble to myself,
I will, as you request, most willingly do SO. I add this more-
over, to let you know the news that Ι have received from the
Netherlands, which are now under the authority of king
Philip; namely, that towards the end of last March, a Dutch·
gentleman, named Mons. Lumell [Lumey] attacked a certain
sea-port in Holland, called the Brill, and took it by force from
the dominion of king Philip. I have heard too, that afterwards
a thousand Spaniards and Walloons, subjects, I mean, of king·
Philip who speak the French language, entered the town of
Middleberg, and in their progress laid waste a certain village
of Zeeland called Armuyden. There is also a large body of
troops collected in Flushing from Franco and England and
other neighbouring countries; but I hear that nothing of any
consequence has been done by the Spaniards against those who
are at the Brill, or in F lushing above mentioned, except what
I shall afterwards state. But a very short address was latei-v
brought hither from Flanders, printed both in Freneh and
Dutch, in which the prince of Orange adopts the same title>-
οἷ’ honour and authority as he did in the Netherlands before
his exile⁶; and ho exhorts the Dutch, who have already been

her friend and allv‚· but gave her over to the queen’s majosty, what-
soever demands they had made for her before. The league was after-
wards confirmed and signed by very honourable ambassadors sent over
on both sides; viZ. Montmoreney from Franco, and the lord admira!
from England. Strype, Annals, 11. i. 211, 214. For all the articles of
this treaty see Canulen, Eliz. p. 1852]
