resisting the Spaniards, eit-her now or never to shew themselves
men against the tyranny and unjust exactions of that people‚
and against the bishops of those parts, and the clergy their
companions3 and he assures them, that if they will but shew
themselves men, they can easily shake off the heavy yoke of
bondage‚ which the duke of Alva with the Spaniards and
bishops aforesaid has most iniquitously imposed upon them,
not only against the common weal or public good of that
country, but also against the honour and good faith of king
Philip. Moreover‚ in the month of March last, part of the city
of Valenciennes, in the province of Hainaust, in French
Flanders, revolted from the government of the aforesaid duke
of Alva, and drove out the Spaniards and leading authorities of
the place; and allowed the Count Lewis, brother of the prince
of Orange, with eight hundred or a thousand armed soldiers (of
whom the greater part are French‚) to enter and garrison the
city for the service of king Philip, as they pretended, though
they reject the authority of the duke of Alva and his party.
But from that time, because the said troops neglected to
occupy the fortress of Valenoiennes, they were forced again to
retreat, and leave the city to the duke and his soldiers‚ who
very lately arrived there in great numbers.

We have next heard for a fact that a city called Venlo‚
the least city in Guelderland, has also sent back his messenger
to the duke of Alva; and that, like Brill and Flushing, many
other cities in the Netherlands have revolted and fallen away
from the duke of Alva, on account of the tyranny which he
has of late years exercised among them. Besides this, it is
related to me as a certain fact, that two small vessels coming
from Flushing have arrived in the Thames, in which letters
are brought conveying the intelligence to some Dutch residents
in this country, that a great sea-fight took place last week on
the sea-coast of Flanders‚ not far from Sluys. The citizens of
Flushing, whose strength and power seems now to be composed
of fomigners, took at the same time, midway between Flanders
and Flushing, fifteen or sixteen vessels laden with spices and

which threatened him, and retii-ed to his paterna] estate and dominions
in Germany. Hc was cited to appear before Alva's tribunal, was con-
demned in absence, was declared a rebel, and his ample posscssions in the
low countrics were confiscated. Humen]
