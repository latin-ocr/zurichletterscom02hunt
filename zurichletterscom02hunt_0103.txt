rich merchandise, besides some specim which ships had come
from Spain and Portugal, and were on their way to Antwerp,
together with thirty or forty ships of war and transports
which conveyed the duke of Medina Geli with twelve hundred
Spanish soldiers who accompanied him, and landed in the
Netherlands. For king Philip has appointed this duke of
Medina Oeli his vice-roy in Flanders, because the said king,
as it is reported, has determined that the duke of Alva shall
go back to Spain.

Then again, it is stated, and this* too as a certain fact, that
the same citizens of F lushing drove upon the shallows two or
three other of the ships which they took, and there wrecked
them; besides which they set on fire and destroyed two or
three more. But, as many persons here assei-t, these two οι·
three ships last mentioned as being burnt, were laden with
Spanish wool on their way to Bruges⁷ and were included in the
thirty or forty ships which came from Spain under the care
and convoy of the said duke of Medina Oeli; and not of the
number of the fifteen or sixteen vessels which were going to
Antwerp‚ and which were taken in sight of Flushing and
Middleberg: but it seems to me very lamentable that the
merchants of Antwerp, (who without doubt are not more
favourably inclined to that impious and crucl duke of Alva
than those who are now at the Brill and Flushing,) and the
merchants of Spain and PortugaL should bc plundered in this
way of their goods and merchandise, and perhaps the greater
part of their crews slain, drowned, or hung; so that there is
reason to sear, that in the countries subject to king Philip
there will be for some years to come as little business and
traffic, as it is called, and as great and extensive civil wars as
have within these few years taken place in Franco„ unless it
should please Almighty God to turn asido his indignation from
the Netheflands, as we must pray him to do according to his
mercy. Farewe113 and may Almighty God very long preserve
you to the advancement of his glory and the edification of his
church! London, J uly 10, 1572.
