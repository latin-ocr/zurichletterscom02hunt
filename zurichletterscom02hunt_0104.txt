LETTER CV.

BISHOP HORN TO HENRY BULLINGER.

Dated at FARNHAM CAs'rLE, Jcm. 10, 1573.

GRACE and peace in Christ! Though you truly describe
me, my Bullinger, beloved in Christ, as one who is for the
most part disti-acted by numerous and important engagements,
as well by those of a private nature as by the public affairs
both of church and state; yet, however I may be occupied,
I have always leisure both for reading and answering your
letters. For as your conversation, when present,⁴ was always
delightful to 1119, 50 now your letters in your absence are most

of your 191191· which is of the greatest importance, and
wherein you make so earnest and positive a request, that you
may learn from 1119 what is the present posture of affairs both
in church and state, in this and the neighbouring 90111111195.

Respecting France first of all, you have doubtless heard

and calamitous condition of the churches in those quarters;
'how that unhappy country, still dripping (as it were) with a
”horrible and bloody slaughter¹, is foully dyed in the blood of
the saints. In which we have this solitary but yet certain
comfort, that, as the blood of Christians is the seed of 1119
gospel, so, in proportion as they shall have 501111 1119 seed
’111019 abundantly, we may expect a more abundant harvest.

Respecting 1119 Belgio affairs I have hardly any thing to
communicate. The Prince [of Orange], resting the whole of
‘this winter season in Hossand, has done nothing worthy of
notice that I know of. It does not yet appear what he will
