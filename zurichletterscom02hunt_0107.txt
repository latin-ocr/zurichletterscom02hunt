(lo when the spring eomes on. But as the alliauee with
France is now at an end, I am afraid lest all things should
become worse.

Seotland, under her present circumstances, is quiet, and
desii-es peace. For the majority have gone over to the king's·
party, who reigns by almost universal consent. But what will
be the issue of this peace, in this uncertain state of affairs in
general, we are unable to determine3 we hope indeed, as we
also wish, sor the best.

Our England, having seeured tranquillity at home and
peace abroad, is sailing as it were with full sails and a prosper-
ous breeze. The ehureh, however, is vehemently agitated, and
not without danger3 not so much from the 0pp‹‘›sition of the
papists, who are daily restrained by severe laws, as· by the
stumbling-blocks occasioned by false bretluen, who seem to be
sliding into anabaptism. May the Lord J esus at length, by
his coming down from heaven, extinguish all the flames os this
tumultuous world, and so take away the sorrows of the
militant chureh, that all tears may be wiped away from our
eyeS, and we may all triumph together with him for ever in the
heavenly and new Jerusalem !

Farewell in Christ J esus. From my eastle at Farnham,
Jan. 10, 1572. [1573]

Yoiu·s wholly in Christ,

ROBERT WINTON.
