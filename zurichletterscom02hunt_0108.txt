278 Β15ΗοΡ PARKHunsr [LET .

The queen of Scotland still remains among us. She was
in great alarm for herself last parliamentl, and not without
reason3 for had not the extreme clemency of our queen
prevented it, it would have been all over with her. What
will be done respecting 1161· 111 the next parliainent, I cannot
tell. She has certainly very few friends in this country. And
what wonder, when she has been hankering after this king-
dom, and is defiled and almost overwhelmed with so many and
great crimes ἓ

Since those tln·ee quarrelsome 111630116152 have been sent
away from hence, the greatest quiet and unanimity is prevailing
in the Dutch church. Your reply to the Bavarian articles3 is
translated into English, and is in every one's hands. I received
another letter from you on December loth, in which you write
that 3 great disturbance had arisen 111 the Grisons. The pope,
who is the author of this and every thing else that is bad, is
going 011 111 1115 old way. But it 15 well that it 15 put an end
to by the death of that most popish vagabond, who endeavoured
to restore popery. On the first of April will commence our
famous sittings of parliament. The frost and snow have
continued these eight weeks, and almost without intermission
during the whole time. But, praised be God! they have at
length left us.

F arewell, my excellent Bullinger. Salute in my name all

[1 A few days after the parliament met, the lord keeper sent for the
lower house, and declared to them, that it was the queen’s pleasure, that
a certain number of the upper house, and of the lower, should the next
morning meet together in the star-chamber, to consult and debate upon
the queen of Scots' inattch. A committee accordingly was appointed
of commoners, to meet with 1116 lords, to consider how to proceed in
that great cause. And after the conference, Mr Attorney of the court of
wards made repert of that eonference. And at length it was resolved,
for the better safety and preservation of the queen, and the present state,
to proeeed against the Scottish queen in the highest degree of treason.
And therein to touch her, as well in life, as in title and dignity ,· and
that of necessity, with all possible speed, by the voice of the house. The
queen however, for certain respeets by herself conceived‚ thought good
for this time to defer, but not to reject, that course of proceeding.
