LETTER CVII.

BISHOP COX TO RODOLPH GUALTER.

Dated at ELY, Feb. 4, 1573.

Youn two letters, Rodolph, dearly beloved in Christ, were
brought. to me last summer, and received not without great
satisfaction. The‘* first exhibited the exceeding ingenuousness
of a pious breast: for you will rarely meet with persons
endowed with such sincerity of mind, as to take in good part
the advice of a friend; but the grace of the Holy Spirit has
enlightened and imbued you with that charity, that you hope
all things, and believe all things, and interpret all things for
the best. But your last letter most clearly manifested a true
brotherly affection to our church, as well as towards myself
and some of my episcopal brethren; since, namely, you
vouchsafed to do us the honour of dedicating to us your
exposition of the epistles of Saint Paul to the Corinthians·''.
This exposition indeed is so learned, pious, and perspicuous,

[⁵ About tho autumn of 1572 did Gualtcr publish ni11vty·five homilics
upon the former epistle to the Corinthians, which hc dedicated to bishops
Grindal, Sandys, Horn, Cox, Parkhurst, and Pilkington. Ιιι his prefatory
epistle to them, his argument ran chiefly of the unity of the rhun-lu
wherein he shewed, that none ought rashly to depart from its society for
the vices of any that lived in it. See Strype, Life of Parkcr, 11. 113.
