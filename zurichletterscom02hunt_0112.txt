280 BISHOP cox [LET.

that it needs no commendation of mine, which indeed is but
of little value. By your having subjoined an admonition to
brotherly unity, you manifestly evince that you entertain the
greatest affection towards our church, and desire that we
should serve the Lord our God without hinderance and dis-
traction of mind. For it is in this way that the glory of God
and the gospel of our Lord J esus Christ may be promoted
with the greatest success⁷ although there must needs be
heresies in the mean time for the trying of the elect. You
make use of many arguments in your preface, and those most
powerful ones3 but I dare not decide what weight they will
have with our innovators. Meanwhile, however, I will not
doubt but that the word of the Lord will bring forth its fruit
in due season.

I return you my best thanks for the book you sent me.
If Ι am unable fully to return your kindness, I will not in the
mean time cease from taking care of and providing for your
son of excellent promise, so long as he shall sojourn among US.
And as far as he is concerned, I must desire you to shut both
your ears: for you would desei-vedly think me most ungrate-
ful„ if I did not shew you some little kindness. When I had
entirely gone over your preface, I was exceedingly sorry that
it had been published before you had been fully acquainted
with the absurdities of our people. For they have lately
broken down, by their abusive writings, the barriers of all
the order of our church. But that you may partly under-
stand their design, I send you some heads or articles, which
they have printed, and taken upon themselves to maintain.
I could wish that you, together with my very dear brother in
Christ, master Bullinger, would consider and decide upon theim
and if it is not too much trouble, that you would send me
your opinion respecting them.

Articles drawn up by certain Englishmen now disturbers
of the state of the Anglican church:

Ι. The names and functions of archbishops, bishops, and
other officials, ought to be altogether abolished.

ΙΙ. The election of the minister-s of the word and sacra·
ments should be restored to the people, as not belonging to the
episcopal office.
