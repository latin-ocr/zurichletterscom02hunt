I ΙΙ. No one ought to be confined to set forms of prayer.

IV. ΝΟ sacrament 011ί 111 to bc administered 1111110111
being preceded by a ser,n1on preached, 111111 1101 read.

V. The father alone ought to 1111511οι· for 1115 child in
baptism, without any other sponsors.

VI. All the ministers of 1110 church ought to be espxal,
not one superior to another.

VII. They condemn the order of confirmation, in which
the bishops lay their hands upon the children 011 their repeating
the catechism, and pra) the Lord th 11 110 11111 muchs-ase to
increase in them the knowledge of his 110111 111111 godliness.

VIII. They cannot endure the sermons which 1110 preached

There are, moreover, other things really too absurd, with
which J am unwilling 10 take up your time, and weary you
with my too troublesome importunity. Satan is envious of our
prosperity. It is not enough to have the papists our enemieS,
without stirring up men of their opinion who are labouring to
bring about a revolution in the church. One thing Ι 111111
almost forgotten to mention. There came out last summer an
immense volume by one Nicolas Saunders, who is, they say, a
countryman of ours3 the title of which is ‘⁶ The Monarchy of
the Oln1rcl11.” He appears to have been a mercenary employed
by certain cardinals, aided by the assistance of 0111015, 111111
decked out like AEsop's jack-daW. The tempest is violent, and
would seem to demolish all our protensions at 0110 blast. It
takes away from christian magistrates the right of deciding 111
matters of religion, and 011111115ξ3 11 entirely for &the pope and his
Officers as the supremeg governor of the 011111011.Οι11 fiiend
J ewel is dead, and has left among us but few equal 10 111111.
