282 Brsnor cox 'ro RODOLPH GUALTER. [LET.

It is therefore both your concern and mine, to cut off the heads
of this hydra. I have your book respecting the pope being
antichrist, which this man takes much pains to refute. You
will not, Ι hope, allow him to triumph. May the great and
good Grod preserve you many years for the safety of his
church!

From the Isle of Ely in England. Feb. 4, 1572, accord-
ing to the English computation.

Ι send you a remembrance, though a very small one, of five
English crowns.

Your most attached brother in Christ,
RIOHARD ELY,
bishop in England.

LETTER CVIII.

 

BISHOP COX TO HENRY BULLINGER.

[Without date.]¹

Youn letter, reverend brother in Christ, cannot be other-
wise than agreeable to me, breathing as it does so much piety
and kindness. I heartily congratulate you on the possession of
those bodily powers which you mention, and which by the
grace of Grod will enable you to perform your office. May our
gracious Lord preserve them to you for many years, to the
glory of his name and the edifying of the church !

I glory in the Lord together with you, that having reached
through his bounty my seventy-fourth year, I am not so
deprived of strength as to be unable to do credit, in some
measure at least, to the situation in which I am placed;
excepting only that a trembling of my hands in some degree
hinders the use of my pen. Ι only enti-eat my Lord that I
may never become indolent in my office, but that Ι may grow
more and more active even unto the last act of the drama. I

[² This letter seems to have been sent at the same time with the
preceding one, and is therefore arranged accordingly]
