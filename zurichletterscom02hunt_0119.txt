of the word into incredible disfavour with the people, and also
with the magistrates and nobility. Nay, they even reject this·
order as being of no use to the church of Christ, and are
striving by every means in their power that it may be alto-
gether abolished. But the Lord God has imbued our most
religious queen and some of her prineipal ministers with that
discretion and piety, that these men, as I hope, will strive 10

this kind are the Anabaptists, Donatists, Arians, papists, and
all the good-for-nothing tribe of the sectarios. 131110111- solid

of Christ and saith is maintained inviolate, proceed from siu-

estimation of your character, they are indeed eontemptible. who
desist not from attacking the character of all good men: they
are unable however to injure either your reputation or mine
by their revilingS. For it is not to them, but to the Lord.
