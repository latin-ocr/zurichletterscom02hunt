one who sineerely praises you to your face. Go on as you have
begun. Exalt the Lord God in your writings; edify the chureh
by explaining her mysteries, instruct the unlearned, excite
the learned to exerti0n3 exhort, advise, rebuke each; and you
will have the Lord, who is 1110 universal inspector of all
mankind, as the most ample approver and rewarder of the
labours you have bestowed in the dressing of his vineyard.

But here, I pray you, pause awhile with me, and mourn
over this our church at this time so miserably divided, not to
say, wholly rent in pieces. Commend her to the Lord your
God, and entreat him that, having compassion upon us, he
may very soon provide some godly remedy for the healing of
