authority, and cannot make any innovation without the sanction
of the queen, or abrogate any thing without the authority of
the laws; and the only alternative now allowed us is, whe-
ther we will bear with these things 01· disturb the peace of
the church. I wish all parties would understand and follow
your wholesome advice in your preface to the Epistle to the
Corinthians, respecting· the variety of rites and discipline in
individual churches. But these men are crying out that no-
thing is to be endured in the rites of the cliui-ch, which is
later than the times of the apostles‚ and that all our discipline
must be derived from thence, and this at the peril of the soul
and our eternal salvation.

Accept, I pray you, in good part these few erowns in
token of my regard for you and for your sound doctrine. I
would have offered more, bnt we are making a collection for
the poor French¹ [protestants] who, exiled and plundered of
their property, have taken refuge partly at Gencva, and partly
in this country.

You will learn from the aceompanying verses all that has
been done in Scotland. I salute in the Lord all your brethren
in the ministry, and especially the reverend master Bullinger,
to whom I beg my excuses for not having written to him in—
dividually; and I pray‚ that since you are both one, you will
be satisfied with this one letter. Gommunicate it, if you
please‚ to him, that he may sympathise and condole in our
missor-tunes. May the Lord J esus long preserve happy Zurieh
in her ancient peace and the sear of God! Farewell in the
Lord, my very (lear brother in Christ. J uly 20, 1573.

The great admirer of your learning and piety,

JAMES PlLKINGTON‚

[¹ The case of the Freneh Church in London had been before reeom-
mcnded by the queen to the Archbishop of Canterbury and other bishops
in 1569, on the breaking· out of the third civil war in Franee between
the papists and the eonfederate protestants. The arehbishop recom-
mended the case to the dean and chapter of Canterbury, in whose
register this order is extant: “Anno 1569, June 8, agreed, that there
shall be, at the contemplation of the lord archbishop his graee's letters,
given out of the church treasury to the poor [afflicted] French Church
in London, towards their relief, six pounds, thirteen shillings and four-
pence.'' Strype, Annals, 1. ii. 290]
