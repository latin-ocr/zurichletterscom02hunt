Dated at Oxronn, July 28, 1573.

IMMANUEL. Your son Gualter, together with your letter,
came to me at Oxford. He is the very image of yourself, and
a true Zuinglian2. He is living in Magdalene college, agree-

university. The Earl of Bedford, and Pal-khurst, your friend
and our bishop, reverenced by me on many accounts, have
given him letters of introduction; so that both for your sake
and at the request of these distinguished men, I have admitted
him to my friendship and to my college, congratulating myself
that I have such an inmate3. Parkhurst most fully promises to

again to Dr Umphrey and Mr (5010, to provide the same for yon. And
at one of their hands you shall receive what yon have need ‹›f; und
I will sce the Same discharged.‘' Ile concluded his letter with his
counsel: “ If you apply yourself to your studies, and do well, you >hall
want nothing, but shall find inc, not a friend only, bnt :morht-1· father
unto yon. God keep yon, and give yon grace to ‹lo that bec-smoth yon,
to his glory, and all your friends’ comt'ort.” See Stry-pe, Ann. 11. i. 3:32]
