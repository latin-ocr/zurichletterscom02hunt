290 LAcnssxen HUMPHREY To RODOLPH GUALTER. [LET.

most solemn. For this it is that a talent is bestowed on
you by the Lord; for this, peace and leisure and retirement
are afforded you3 for this, the convenience of a most excel-
lent press, that in this abundance of every thing, and with this
best of opportunities, you may be of use to us Britons, divided
as we are from all the world, and standing in need of almost
all these means of assistance. However, by the blessing of
God, all things are now at peace among us, notwithstanding
our neighbour‘s house is on fire. For the torch of civil war
in France and Flanders is not yet put out, although a con-
ference is being held respecting some honourable conditions
of peace.

In Scotland, the virgin castle of Edinburghss for so the
Scots called it, albeit hitherto unconquered, is at last reduced
and taken. Our queen² subdued it, not for herself, but for
the young king. Their queen, therefore, being kept in cus-
tody in this country, and all the conspirators having either·
surrendered or been destroyed, not only a mutual alliance is
taking place among US, but the same religion received by
universal consent is prospering in that kingdom. May the
Lord J esus preserve, and load with every blessing, both yom-
self and your friends, masters Bullinger, Simler, Lavater, ἅτε.
and the whole church! In haste, in the midst of our Mag-
dalene connnemoration. Oxford, July 28, 1573.

Your most devoted,

LAURENCE HUMPHREY.

[1 The castle surrendered on the 28th of May, being the 33rd day of
the siege 3 for an account of which see Camden’s Elizabeth, p. 197]

[² Sir Thomas Smith was earnest with the queen, to send aid to
reduce the rebels in scotland, who had fortified Edinburgh Castle against
the king and regent ,· and for that purpose hc let the queen understand
from Mr Killigrew, her ambassador in scotland, how dangerously things
stood there, and therefore that it was his desire that the peace-malcen-
(as hc phrased it) might shortly be transported thither ,· to whom, when
the queen asked, “ who be they 2'’ “Mamm'' said he, “your majesty's
cannons3 they must do it, and make a final conclusion.” “ Then,’' said
the queen, “I warrant yon, and that shortly.’' Strype, Life of Smith,
129. See Smith's Letter to Lord Burghleigh, MS. Harl. 6991, 14.]
