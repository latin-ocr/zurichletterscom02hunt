LETTER CXII.

 

ARCHBISHOP GRINDAL TO HENRY BULLINGER.

Dated at Yonn, July 31, 1573.

HEAL'rn in Christ! About the end of December last, my
(learcst master Bullinger‚ I received your letter written on the
24th of August; on which day, by a savagc and unheard of
cruelty, the Admiral³ with other nobility‚ and the greatest
part of the faithful, were massacred at Paris. These are the
fruits of that egregious treaty with Franco, from which we
expected so much advantage! The Sicilian Vespers⁴ indeed
were infamous of old; but these French Matius, if I may so
call them, leave them far behind. The Lord beholds these
things, and will make inquisition. Many exiles⁵ from France
have sought refuge in London, and among them many ministers
of the churches‚ who are there kindly received with hospitality.)
and supported by the alms of the godly.

Our affairs, after the settlement of the controversy respect-
ing ceremonies, were for some time very quiet: when some
virulent pamphlets6 came forth, privately printed, contrary

[³ Viz. Coligni. ‘⁶ De Thou, perhaps, falls short rather than exceeds
in his computation, when hc fixes thc whole number of Huguenots who
perished, at little below thirty thousand 3 of that number at least onc-
third may bc allotted to Paris.'' See Sinedley's Hist. of the Rcsormed
Religion in Franco, Vol. 11. p. 34, and the testimonies there cited]

[⁴ The massacre of the French in Sicily on Easter Monday, March 30,
1282]

[⁵ See p. 288]

[⁴⁵ The admonitiou to the I‘arllainent, soon after the publishing of
it, was backed with three other pamphlcts, sent to Dr Whitgift, as
it were a challenge3 which he bricfly answered towards the end of
his answer to the admonition. Thc first was a prefaee to the other
two. The second was called, An Exhortation to the Bislmsm to deal bro-
therly with thei)- bream-en. The third, Αη Eahortation to tlte Bislmps aud
their Cletyy, to ‹mswcr a little Book· that came jin-th {lm las-t I'arliameul,·
and to the other bretlzren, to jndyc of it hg] Gorl's tvm-(l, until they sm] it
zen-emerem and not bc carried (ωιτη-ι] with (my respect ⁰s meu. See Strype,
Life of Whitgift, Vol. 1. p. 80, ἃς. who gives a full account of the above
writings]
