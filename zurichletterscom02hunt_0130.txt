292 Anonmsuor camon, [LET-

to law, in which almost the whole external polity of our
church was attacked. For they maintain that archbishops
and bishops should altogether be reduced to the ranks3 that
the ministers of the church ought to be elected solely by
the people; that they ought all to be placed upon an equafity:
that in every city, town, parish, or village, a consistory
should be established, consisting of the minister and elders
of the place, who alone are to decide upon all ecclesiastical
affairs: (they state) that the church of England has scarcely
the appearance of a christian churclu-that no set form of
prayer ought to be prescribed, but that in the holy assemblies
each minister should pray as the Holy Ghost may dictate;
that the infants of popish recusants, as far as the use of
baptism is concerned, are unclean, (I use their own words,)
but yet that they are not on that account to be excluded
from the election of God. I pass over many things which
it would be tedicus to recount. But a royal edict was lately
published, in which libels of this sort are forbidden to be
circulated for the future; which circumstance, as I hope,
will retard their endeavours. They are young men who dis-
seminate these opinions, and they have their supporters,
especially from among those who are gaping for eccle—
siastical property: but yet I am glad to say, that Hum-
phrey, and Sampson, and some others, who heretofore moved
the question about ceremonies, are entirely opposed to this
party.

The castle of Edinburgh in Scotland, about which I
before wrote, having been battered for twenty successive days
by our English cannon, was at length forced to surrender
on the 28th of May last. The chief rebels¹ were punished:
so that at this time the whole of Scotland is reduced to
obedience under the young king, and is altogether alienated
from the French, both on account of the difference of religion,
and the cruelty which was last year exercised towards the
faithfuh but most devoted to our queen (who has so often
defended the liberties of the Scots,) as you may easily see
by the inclosed verses, printed at Edinburgh.
