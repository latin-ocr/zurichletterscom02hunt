The affairs of Franco are sufficiently known to you. In
Holland and Zealand the prince of Ora-nge is superior in
his navy, but on land the contest is always doubtful. May
the Lord take eompassion on his church, and at length put
an end to these evils, that we may with one mouth glorify
him, whom Ι pray very long to preserve your piety in safety
to his churchl York, the last day of July, 1573.

Your most devoted in the Lord,

EDMUND YORK.

RS. It was my intention, God willing, to have sent
you at the spring fair some little remembrance of me, which
however was not ready at that time through the neglect of
the workman.

LETTER CXIII.

 

ARCHBISHOP GRINDAL TO RODOLPH GUALTER.
Dated at Yonx, July 31, 1573.

HEALTH in Christ, my very dear master Gualter! Your
desire that your lately published Ηο111111052 on the first Epistle
to the Corinthians should appear under my name and that of
some other very dear- brethren and fellow-labourers‚ was very
gratifying to 111ος and 011 that account, as far as concerns
myself, (and I hope the others will do the same,) I return
your piety my best thanks. Your son sent 1110 two copies
bound, one of which I forwarded to the lord bishop of Durliani,
to whom, as he writes me word, the present was most accept-
able; the other I retain inyself. There is 110 reason why you
should be so eareful to apologize for your frcedom in writing to
1110. For although you are not personally known 101110, you
arc well known to 1110 by your writings, abounding as they do
in singular erudition and learning, and 011 account of 1110
excellent piety which they breathe, and 1 will add too, 011
account of our most close agreement in the truc doctrine of
Christ, you are most dear 10 1110.
