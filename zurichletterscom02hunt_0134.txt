'294⁴ ARCHBISHOP GRINDAL 'ro RODOLPH GUALTER. [LET.

As I am myself far distant from Cambridge, I have
earnestly recommendes} your son to Dr John Whitgift‚ the
master of his college¹3 whom I have also requested to shew
himself a sufficiently severe censor of his morals, should there
be any occasion for his doing so. But I hope there will be
no occasion for this3 for I hear that your son is very
studious and modest, and far removed from all levity of
conduct.

I wrote a few lines to Bullinger respecting our affairs,
which he doubtless will communicate to you. I wrote likewise
to Richard Hilles, a merchant of London, that he should take
care to transmit to you, at the next Frankfort fair, fifty French
crowns ; namely, thirty from myself, and the remaining twenty&
from the bishop of Durham, whose letter yon will receive
at the same time with this. We pray you to take in good part
this little present. Fare-well in Christ, my very dear brother
in the Lord. York, the last day of July, 1573.

Yours in Christ,

EDMUND YORK.

debt3 both because you have always regarded me with the
greatest kindness and affection, and because you have con-
descended to write to me so diligently and so frequently. For
all which things, though I cannot make an equal return, yet I
will thank you as much as I can, and shall at all times readily
acknowledge myself very much indebted to you for your pecu—
liar kindness.

Yon must not impute it to neglect that I so seldom write
to you, but to the unfrequency of the means of communication
between us, especially in these most turbulent times, when war
