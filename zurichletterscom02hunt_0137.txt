cxlv] BISHOP SANDYS To 1113an BULLINGER. 295

and tumults and slaughter are every where rife. For there is
no one to whom I should write with greater pleasure than to
master Bullinger, whom, as Ι have always loved him exeeed-
ingly sor his great courtesy, so have Ι also much venerated
'l'or his singular erudition, and rare piety, and other excellent
qualities. For when Ι 0311 to my remembrance, as Ι very
often do, with how much favour and regard I was entertained
by you, how like a brother and a friend you treated me when
an exile, and the comfort in which I seemed to myself to live
among you, I wish for nothing more than that, relieved from
those cases and anxieties with which I am now overwhelmed, Ῑ

established by the entire consent of most excellent men; and
are striving to shape out for us, I know not what new platform
of a church. And you would not imagine with what appro-
bation this new face of things is regarded, as well by the people
as the nobility. The people are fond of change, and seek after
liberty; the nobility [seek for] what is useful. These good
folks promise both, and that 111 abundance. But 11131 you may
be better acquainted with the whole matter, accept this sum-
mary of 1110 question at issue reduced under certain heads:

1. The civil magistrate has no authority in ecelesiastica]
matters. He is only a member os the church, the government
of which ought to be committed to the clergy.

2. The church of Christ admits of 110 011101· governinent
