296 BISHOP saxnrs [LET.

deans, chancellors, commissaries, and other titles and dignities
of the like kind, should be altogether removed from the church
of Christ.

4. Each parish should have its own presbytery.

5. The choice of ministers of necessity belongs to the
people.

6. The goods, possessions, lands, revenues, titles, honours,
authorities, and all other things relating either to bishops or
cathedrals, and which now of right belong to them, should be

the reformed churches on their side.

I say nothing of the state of our commonwealth: every
thing is quiet hitherto, but it is to be feared that these in-
testine dissensions may tend at length to the ruin of the
country.

Isend your reverence as much English eloth as will make
you a gown. Make use of it, I pray you, and accept it with
your wouted kindness. Farewell, most esteemed sir, and com-
