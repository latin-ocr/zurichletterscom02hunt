to many persons9 they had already obtained a handle for
confirming their 011015, 110 thought that the publication of
your 101101·ι 10 1110 would tend very much to the defence of the
truth. Your first letter was extol-ted from you by those who
falsely accused 115; 11111 the simple truth brought the second to
light. And there is 110 reason why you should be disturbed
about the publication of what has procured credit and reputa-
tion to yourself‚ inasmuch 05 11 espouses the cause of truth, of
which no one ought to be ashamecl.

I acquainted you with some of the errors of our 111011, 111 the
questions I proposed to you; and you have gratified me most
exceedingly by the candid and sincere declaration of your senti-
ments: for the opinions of masters Bullinger and Gualter are of
no little weight in our church. But these disputants of ours are
so shuffling and so 10110010115 of their own opinion, that they will
give way to no one who opposes their judgment 3 and they are
striving to draw' all your writings over to their side by a per-
verted interpretation of them. To give you an instance of their
candour, they are zealously endeavour-ing to overthrow the en-
tire order of our Anglican church. N ight and day do they im—
portune both the people and the nobility, and 5111 them up to
abhorrence of those persons who, on the abolition of popery, are
faithfully discharging the duties of the ministry3 and they busy
themselves in everywhere weakening and diminishing 111011
credit. And that they may effect this with greater ease and
plausibility‚ they bawl out 10 111050 harpies who are greedily
hankering after plunder and spoil7 that the property and
revenues of the cathedr-al churches ought to be diverted to
I know not what other uses. N or will they allow bishops to
take any other precedence than as individua] pastors in their
respective parishes‚ whose highest authority they wish to be

friend Bishop Parkhurst, who had sojourncd four years at his house
at Zurich3 and therein hc sharply blamed him, and the rest of the
hishops, for pressing such indifferent things, and punishing so heavily
those who complied not with them. Of this letter, (for bishop Cox's
reply to which see Letter xcxv.) several copies were taken, so that
falling into the hands of the Puritans, they printed it with one of Beza's
in the said book, called lese Admonition, in justification of themselves.
