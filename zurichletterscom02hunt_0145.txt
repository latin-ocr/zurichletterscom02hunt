climacteric. My wife is, according to her own account,
sixty-seven years old and inore. Ι rejoice that all is quiet
in Switzerland. I am not sorry that the business about the
hired troops turned out so unhappily. The harvest with us
here in Norfolk did not begin before the feast of Bartho-
lomew², and was very wet and showery. There was searee
a fine (lay during the whole harvest, so that no small quantity
of grain was lost, though the greatest portion was saved by
the unwcaried diligence of the labourers. The dearth not
only of wheat, but of every thing else, is very great among
us. Do you ask, whence proceeds this carim? It is be-
cause our charitgs is growing cold among 115³. Before the
feast of the Purification⁴ we had no snow in these parts, and
scarcely felt the cold. We have now plenty of both.

Salute, I pray you, in my name all my friends, and Julius
himself not among the last of them. Woe betide that worst
of all cossectors, Thymelthorp⁴³, who will not allow me to collect
any thing for my friends! But I hope better things. May
God preserve you, and all my Zurich friends! Amen. ln
haste. London, February 6, 1574. My wife salutes you and
yours. Farewell.

Yours,

JOHN PARKHURST,
[bishop] of Norwich.
