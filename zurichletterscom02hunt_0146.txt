LETTER CXVII.

 

BISHOP PARKHURST TO JOSIAH SIMLER.

Dated at LUDHAM, Feb. 7, 1574.

Ox the 20th of August I received your letter of the 22nd
of February, 1573. That youth William Barlow, to whom
you gave it, was never, as far as I am awai-e, known to⁷ or
seen by me. That ubiquitarian J ames Andreas1‚ who threatens
to write against the divines of Wittemberg‘2 and my Zurich
friends, will lose his labour and betray his folly to every one.
So far are we English from defending either the ubiquitarian
or any other monstrous opinions, that we cannot endure them.
We only dispute about cei-emonies and habits⁷ and things of
no importance. Ο that these skirmishes and contentions may
at length be laid to rest and buried in oblivion Ξ The papists

, are certainly chelishing, I know not what expectations; but

I hope without reason. May the Lord grant an end (finem)
to these things, and a halter (funem) to the papists. I hope
our friend Magdalen has many months since recovered from

the aque.
May the Lord release from the gout both you and my

wife. Amen. Ludham, February 7, 1574. Salute your wife
and all my friends. My wife salutes you all.

Yours,
JOHN PARKHURST‚

[bishop] of Norwich.

[³ Jacobus Andreas was a professor at Tubingen‚ and head of the
Ubiquitarians in Germany. Sec Strype, Annals, 11. ii. 104. He was now
employed, under the patronage of the elector of Saxony, and others, in
composing aform of doctrine, in which all the controversics that divided
the church should be terminated and decided. See Mosheim]

[2 Among whom was Peucer, son-in—law to Melancthon, and head of
the univcrsity of Wittemberg. He aimed at nothing less than abolish-
ing the doctrine of Luther concerning the eucharist and the person of
Christ, with a ‹lesign to substitute the sontiments of Calvin in its place.
For these principles he was imprisoned from 1574, after the convocation
of Thorgau, till 1585. See. Mosheim‚ and also Casparis Peuceri Histo—
