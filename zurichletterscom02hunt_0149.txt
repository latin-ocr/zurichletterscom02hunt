LETTER CXVIII.

 

BISHOP PARKHURST To IIENRY BULLINGER.

Dated at ermm, June 259, 1574.

MAY you be safe in Christ, my very dear Bullinger!

In my former letter, which I sent you on ‘the 6111 of F eb-
ruary, I expressed my warmest thanks for that very learned
little treatise which you sent me respecting the perseeutions
of the ehureh, and I now repeat them. The Latin edition
Ι have received3 that in German I have not yet 50011, Your
letter of March lOth came to hand on the 26111 of June, in
which you state that you have now forwarded to 1110 11 certain
reply to the Brentian party, and also two homilies on the
130111 and 133rd Psalms. Neither of these have I received.
’Ν 00 betide those persons by whom 50 great a 1101151110 has
been taken from me!

A certain young Duteh⁸ woman about seventeen or eighteen
years of age, a servant of the preaeher of the ohureh at
Norwieh, was during a whole year miserably vexed by Satan.
In all her temptations, however, and dilacerations, she 0011-
tinued stedfast in the saith, and withstood the 1111101531)- with
more than manly fortitude. At last, by G0<Ps help, tho devil
being overeome left her, and almost at 1110 5111110 instant.
attaeked the son of a certain senator, whom he also tormented
in a most incredible manner for some weeks together. Public
prayers were offered in the city by my direction, and a fast
proelaimed until evening. The Lord had 111010)- 11150 on 1111·
boy, and overeame the enemy. The boy was thirteen or at
most fourteen years old, and, for 1115 age, well versed in 1111·
scripturos, which, stedfast in saith, he 1101111)- launehed forth
against the enemy. The Lord liveth, by whom this boy 111111
girl, of a weak constitution in other respeets, were enabled
to overeome 50 great and terrible an adversary. To God he

the praise !
