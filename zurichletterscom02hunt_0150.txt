301 BISHOP PARKHVRST To 1113an BULLINGER. [LE‘r.

Thai: confessi0n¹ of true religion which you published 111
1566, is now read in English, and in the hands of every
one. The scarcity of all things still continues among 113.
Redolph, the son of our friend Gualter, is coming back to
you: he is a youth well learned, of good talents, and pious
conduct. His father 13 displeased with him for not living
more econ01nically2. If he has acted improperly in this
respect, we must make allowance for his youth. Do you
earnestly enti-eat his father not to receive his returning 3011

Salute, Ι pray you, in my name all my friends, your
sons and daughters, Dor-othy especially, whom Ι 1ν1311 it would
please God to unite in marriage to my friend Rodolph. In-
deed I earnestly desire 11113, and should rej0icc most exceed-

my friend Gualter; and you also, as I hope, will rejoice,
and the Lord will 111633 their union. Farewell, my Bullinger,
and continue to love me. My wife salutes you all. In haste.
Ludham, June 22, 1574.

Yours,

JOHN PARKHURST, N[orwich.]
