upon whom far greater benefits might worthily be bestowed.
Being summoned by his father in a letter sent to me, and
persuaded by your advice, he is now hastening home. I had
intended to have kept him longer in England, and supported
him at the University of Oxford, and that without any expense
to his father; but since it is your wish, he shall depart, not
only without any opposition on my part, but with my entire
consent. Ι will advance his interests even in his absence.

’ It is a marvellous occurrence that a cow should have
brought forth a fawn! But the wonder is diminished, when
the circumstance took place in the neighbourhood of these
portentous monks.

Ι have neither received your little book against the Bren-
tians, nor the Bibliotheca [of Gonrad Gesner] enlarged by
you⁴. Froschover has probably forgotten it; but, however it
be, I thank you for your kindness. I wish you would look out
for a wife for Rodolph. If you are inclined to take my advice,
Dorothea, Bullinger's daughter, shall be the person: for she
is pious, and, like our friend, the offspring of pious parents: so
that you will do well if they should, by your means, be joined
together in holy matrimon'y.

Fare thee well, my dearest Josiah. Greet in my name
our friends Magdalen, Anna, N obilitatula, together with their
husbands. Heartily salute Haller, Lavater, Wonliehius, Wick-
ius, Julius, Froschover, John Henry Fabricius, Michaelis, (if
he is yet alive3) the Meyers, Cellarii, Thaddeus Betta, and

all the rest. My wife salutes you all. Again farewell. In
haste. Ludham, June 30, 1574.

Y ours,

JOHN PARKHURST, N.

[“² Josiah Simler published at Zurich, in 1574, an abridgement of the
Bibliotheca, or Universal Dictionary of Conrad Gesner. Conrad Lycos-
thenes [wolfhart] minister at Basle, had previously undertaken a com-
pendium of this great work 3 but the abridgement of Simler was a much
more able persor-mance, wherein he not only avoided tho defects of
wolfhart, but enriched the work with many valuable additions, which
he marked with an asterisk to distinguish them from the original work.
Frisius published a second edition of Simler's ubridgement in 1583]
