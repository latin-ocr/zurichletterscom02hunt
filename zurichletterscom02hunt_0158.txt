neglected writing. Such neglect, my deal-ly beloved brother
in Christ, would certainly have been criminal, had I suffered
myself so to be branded with the mark of ingratitude as to
be inattentive to the letters of my friends, so pious and
learned and full of kindness, and neglected to return a courte-
ous answer. I wrote a letter to you, I hope not an ungrateful
one, in the year 1573, which, with a little present¹, (trifling
as it was,) I gave in charge to one Richard Hilles, by whose
means it was to be delivered to you. If this has not been
done, Ι will endeavour to ascertain without loss of time, by
whose fault the failure of it has been occasioned.

I understand from your letter, that you are not labouring
under such a decay of old age as to be unable to discharge
without inconvenience the trust committed to you. This

the teacher of all things, and partly by the pious feeling with

which you instruct, advise, comfort, not only the church of
Zurich, but the truly universal ohurch of Christ. Your little
book on persecutions is especially useful in these latter times,
wicked and dangerous as they are, to confirm the godly in
the patience of Christ and in the purity of religion.

You are mistaken if you suppose that I understand Ger-
man. It is now about fifteen years since I had a very slight
knowledge of that language3 but I will take care that your
Swiss sermons shall be translated into Latin, that I may
peruse the'm with greater delight and profit. I grieve that
your churches are disturbed by these unhappy controversies:
how truly did Christ say that the enemy soweth tares! Oh,
may we, all of us, at length be made good ground! Our pul-itan
brethren are now lying in concealment, partly terrified by the
