authority of our queen, and partly sileneed by a most able
treatise written by a most learned nian2. Meanwhile, we know
not what monstrosities they are liatehing‘in secret.

Certain of our nobilityss, pupils of the Roman pontiff, either
weary of their happiness or impatient of the long continued
progress of the gospel, have taken ssight, some into Franee,
some into Spain, others into different places, with the view
of plott-ing some misehief against the professors of godliness.
So difficult is it to keep the ehureh of Christ in a state of
defenee against the ministers of Satan. But the strength of
the Lord and his strong tower have hitherto defended us, and
the Lord will defend his own even to the end, 111 spite of
the ehafing and assaults of those two antichrists. In the
mean time we must enti-eat the Lord night and day to arise
and let his enemies be scattered.

May the Lord ,J esus make your old age of long eonti-
nuanee to his ehureh! As to myself, though in my 75th year,
by the blessing of Grod I am in good health, except that the
trembling of my hands makes it difficult for me to write.

Farewell, my very dear brother in Christ. From the isle of
Ely, in England, J uly 20, 1574.

Your most attached brother in Christ,

RIGHARD,
First minister of the chureh at Ely.
