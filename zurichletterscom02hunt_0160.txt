LETTER CXXII.

LAURENCE HUMPHREY ΤΟ RODOLPH GUALTER.

Dated at Oxrom), Any. 2, 1574.

IMMANUEL. Health in Christ J esus, most esteemed
Gualter. Your son returns to you, not, as you state', a prodi-
gal, but improved both in learning and manners. For my
own opinion respecting him, as well as that of the whole' uni-
versity, will easily be seen from their very copious testimo-
nials. He so lived amongst us, that all are unanimous in
praise of his modesty, his frankness, his many and great
virtues; and consider you most fortunate, that the Lord hath
given you such a Gualter as the inheritor of your name and
piety. The bishop of Norwich will address you by letter, of
whom I shall say nothing; for he is sufficiently known to you,
and your son can bear ample testimony that he has never
found his munificence sti-aitened towards himself. But since
he will explain by letter both the cause of your son's return,
and other matters of the like kind, there is no occasion for
me to repeat them to no purpose.

Dr Parkhurst has informed me that it is your desire, and
I have also learned by other letters from Zurich that his
friends are desirous, that at his present age he should think
both about a matrimonial connection, and also about entering
upon the ministry. That all things may turn out for him most
happily and auspiciously, is my most earnest prayer.

I have received the copy of your treatise on Christ's pre-
sence on earth, but have nothing to send you in return, un-
less you wish to see my, or rather your2 Jewel, whom I now
send by my friend Gualter, and beg you both to correct and
take in good part this trifling present.

[2 The Arehbishop [Pal-ker] and the Bishop of London [Sandys]
knowing the eloquence of Dr Laurence Humphrey’s Latin pen, sent
to him to Oxon commending the writing of Jewel's life to him 3 who
finished and published it anno 1573, and dedicated his work to those
two venei-able prelatos. Sti-xpe, Life of Parker, 11. 50]
