We are here, by the blessing of God, in the possession of
peace, and the pearl of the gospel, and pray that we may long
enjoy them. Our neighbour's wall is on fire, and we are greatly
afraid lest some spark of that fire should set us in a flame.
So heedless are we, and [memmei-ned, that we seem to be daily
kindling the flames of divine wrath. May the Lord JesuS‚
remembering‚ not our merits, but his mercy, avert every evil,
preserve your church, our fathers and brethren, Bussinger,
Simler‚ Lavater and the rest, together with yourself and fa-
mily! In haste, at Oxford‚ Aug. 2, 1574.

Yours‚

LAURENOE HUMPHREY.

LETTER CXXIII.

 

BISHOP SANDYS ΤΟ HENRY BULLINGER.

Dated at Fummm, Auy. 9, 1574.

Maca health in Christ, most esteemed sir and reverend
father.

Ι thank you most sincerely for your very ready and
affectionate inclination to write to me; for indeed nothing
could have been more gratifying to me than to ascertain your
opinion respecting the matters in dispute. You write most
sully your own judgment concerning the wholc affair: Ι see
and embrace it. But I hope that this new fabric of new dis-
cipline will shortly fall in pieces by its own weight, since it
appears that many of our count-rymen who formerly admired it,
are now grown weary of it; and those who seemed most zealous
in the establishinent of this new platform, havc now hegun to
grow wonder-fully cool„ as it were, through a change of opinion.
May the Lord grant that, all our dissensione and strit'e being
removed, wc may all of us spcak and think the sanie thing
according to Jcsns Christ, and that wc may with one mind
and mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord ‘Iesus
Christ !
