the pious and learnedl young man, who will bring you this
letter, will give you certain· information respecting them. The
pirates of F lushing have intercepted the first2 piece of cloth

F ulham in England, Aug. 9, 1574.

Your brother in Christ, and most affectionate,

EDWIN SANDYS,
bishop of London.
