has lately written from ‘thence‘ a treatise in Latin, in defence
of this new discipline which he wishes to obtrude upon us.
l have not yet seen the book, but I hear that it is printed, and
has been brought over to us. As soon as it shall come into
my hands, I will take care it shall be sent you. Respecting
other matters which are agitated here, your son will give you
information. He is preparing for his journey, and I for the
public affairs of the church, with which I am ovcrwhelmed.
The first piece of eloth that I sent you was taken by
pirates: I sent you another, which tho merchant tells me that
you have received. It is well if it is so, Famwell, most
esteemed sir, and continue to love me as you do. In haste.

Fulham in England, Aug. 9, 1574.
Your brother and friend in Christ,

EDWIN SANDYS‚
bishop of London.

History, p. 141, where his character is drawn at length. Beza, in a
letter to one of his English correspondents, thus expressed himself con-
cerning Cartwright: “ Here is now with us your countryman, Thomas
Cartwright, than whom I think the sun does not see a more learned
man.”]

[⁴ Soames gives the following extract from a letter from Wileox
to Gilby, dated Feb. 2, 1574. “Our brother Cartwright is escaped,
(God be praised!) and departed this land, since my coming up to London,
and I hope, is by this time at Heidelberg.” A wan-ant had been issued
for his apprehension, to be attributed probably, Mr Soames thinks, to
the fcar of assassination engendered in Elizabeth and her advisers, by
the fatal ebullition of insanity then lately manifestcd by Peter Birchet,
in the murder of a man whom he mistook for Sir Christopher Hatton.
Among the signatures to this warrant, besides that of Sandys, arc those
of N owell and Goodman, and nine others of the High Commission. See
Soames’s Elizabethan History‚ p. 198]
