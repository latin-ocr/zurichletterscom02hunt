LETTER CXXV.

BISHOP COX TO HENRY BULLINGER.

Dated at ELY, Jcm. 25, 1575.

HEALTH in Christ. I confess myself, my very dear brother,
greatly in your debt, for having so courteously addressed me
by letter, although it was a short one. Your occasional illness
is not to be wondered at, seeing old age itself is a kind of
‹lisease. Should you discontinue your literary exertions, I
shall in the mean time content myself with what you have
by the blessing of God written heretofore, to his glory and the
edifying of his church. But may Grod bestow upon you
sufficient strength for the performance of what you are piously
proposing to accomplish! I rejoice exceedingly that harmony
is restored among you. With ourselves, the faction is become
in some measure less active through fear of punishment, for
our government is apprehensive that danger may arise from
frivolous and unnecessary innovations. And by the same sear
do they keep within bounds the fury of the papists. We hear
however, that in France the adherents of the pope are bring-
ing matters to the last extremities. May the Lord J esus
vouchsafe to be present wit-h his peoplel Oh that the Lord
would bow the heavens and come down, and bridle the mouths
of the papists, Turks, and schismatics 1 But our sins will not
suffer him. God grant that we may all strive together for that
unity to which, by numerous and solid arguments, you beauti-
fully exhort all the clergy.

Salute my brethren in my name, as opportunity presents
itself. I send a small testimony of my regard to be divided
between yourself and Julius, and Ι commend myself to your
prayers. May the great and good God preserve you and your
most religious city 3

From the Isle of Ely in England, -J an. 25, 1574, according
to our computation.

Your most attached and very dear brother in Christ,

RIOHARD,
bishop of Ely.
