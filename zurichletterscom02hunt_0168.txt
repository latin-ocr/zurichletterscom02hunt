among them! Meanwhile by the grace of God we must do
our best, and leave the issue to the Lord our God. The
Lord hitherto by his favour preserves us at peace. The

the hypocrites, whom the Lord in his most righteous judgment‚
on account of their overflowing wickedness‚ is wont to deliver
into the hands of the destroyer3 such as are at this time the
Turk, the pope, and the furious band of schismatics. And
