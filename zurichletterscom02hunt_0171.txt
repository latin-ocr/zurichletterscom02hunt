and clamour they subvert the credulous minds of wretched
persons, and especially those who are gaping, like hungry
wolves and ravens, after the revcnues of the cathedral chumhes,
eolleges‚ and bishops. Thus Satan employs every engine to
overthrow the gospel. I am much grieved that that Saxon¹
is so much incensed against the godly. Nor do I less grieve
for that afflicting intelligenee which is brought us, that the
most solid pillar of the chureh, master Henry Bullinger, is
labouring under a most severe disease. May our gracious
Lord have comp-assion on his church‚ and restore his Hem-y
to his former health! But should it seem good to the divine
merey to place him in his heavenly tabernacle, the F ather
of our Lord J esus Christ must be entreated to pour down
the spirit of this second Elijah upon the many Elishas‚ who
by the singular grace of Grod may now be sojourning in the
most pious city of Zurieh.

There have been lately removed from us by death, having
obtained a better condition with Christ, Parkhurst2‚ the bishop
of Norwieh, and Matthew Parker³⁷ archbishop of Canterbury
and primate of all England, a man of an even and firm cha-
racter, and a zealous defender of true religion. We must en-
treat the Lord that he may vouchsafe to send labourers not less
suitable into his harvest, which is very abundant. May the
Lord Jesus very long preserve you in safety to his chureh!

From the Isle of Ely in England. July 31, 1575.

Your very dear brother in Christ,

RICHARD‚
bishop of Ely.
