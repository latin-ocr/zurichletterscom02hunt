LETTE R CXXVIII.

BISHOP COX TO RODOLPH GUALTER.
[Νῆα]

Your„ last letter, most learned Rodolph, Ι received on the
13tl1 of February. The preceding one however affected me
much more forcibly, both with exceeding sorrow, and also with
no common delight. My sorrow was excessive for the death of
Henry Bullinger ¹, whom, by his letters, and learned and pious
writings, I had been acquainted with, and I may say, known
intimately for many years, although he was never personally
known to me. Who would not be made sorrowful by the loss
of such and so great a man, and excellent a friend? not to
mention that the whole christian church is disquieted with
exceeding regret, that so bright a star is forbidden any longer
to shine upon earth. John writes, that inauspicious stars fell
down from heaven23 but we are persuaded that our star has
ascended up into heaven, and is fixecl in heaven, and as it
shone on earth, so it now shines more brightly in heaven. As
to what he was on earth, his pious reputation is not silent, his
pious life proclaims, his most learned writings abundantly
testify: and what he now is in heaven, God knows, the
angels rejoice, and the souls of the godly exult. And this
is no small consolation to those who regi-et the loss of such a
man. Add also another circumstance, from which I have,
with good reason, received comfort, namely, that the church of
Zurich, on Bullinger's bidding it farewell, is nevertheless not
without a pastor. For the most gracious Lord, who never
forsakes his flock, has set in the place of Bullinger yourself,
who possess no less zeal in feeding the flock, and no less
courage in keeping off its eneinies. Blessed are you, who have
of your own inclination taken upon yourself this burden, that
you may subserve the glory of God, and faithfully advance his
religion.

[l Bullinger departed this life on the 17t11 Sept. 1575]
