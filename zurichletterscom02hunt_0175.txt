With respect to the disturbances and heresies of the
churches, we know that there must needs be heresies that the
elect may be proved; and that through inuch tribulation we
must enter into the kingdom of God, and in patience possess
our souls. It is certainly much to be lamented that the
Saxon³ is so furiously hostile. May (jod grant, some time or
other, a holy reconciliation! We see no hope of peace in
France. All things there are carried 011 in a tyrannical
manner. The king has decreed, with his brother and his
mother, to send all the protestants into banishinent, or else to
put them to death. It is not yet fully known what is doing in
Flanders, except that our queen is busy in settling the dis-
putes. Our men of sivzyalarity are quiet through sear of
punishment, except that they are hatching I know not what
mischief in secret. And those too, who pursue the cares and
things of this world, give us much trouble3 for they are striving
by Ι know not what arts and stratagems, to take away from us
our property⁴, and reduce us to beggary, that they may bring
us back to the condition of the primitive chureh and the
poverty of the apostleS. May God have merey upon his
afflicted church, and defend it from the wiekedness of the
world; and may he bless you all, who profess J esus Christ 3

I have sent you a small token of my reg-ard, a part os
which I wish you to bestow upon Julius Terentianus.

Your brother in Christ Jesus‚

RICHARD COX,
[bishop] of Ely.

[³ The Elector of Saxony. See note 1, p. 315]

[⁴ The bishop had been required not long before to alienate Ely
House in Holborn to Christopher Hatton, the queen's vice-chamberlain ,¹
and Lord North also obtained letters from the queen to the bishop,dated
in May, 1575, to part with the manon- and lands of Somersham. For an
account of these proceedings, and tho bishop’s behaviour in consequence,
