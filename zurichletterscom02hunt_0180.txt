322 BISHOP ΗοΠΝ [Lm.

found in any person, as that when the enjoyment of a holy
peace is within his power, he unhappily prefers to procure
his individual quiet, as it would seem, by the discomfort of
many; when in fact, while he is labouring to satisfy his own
blind, rash, and impious cupidity, he does not so much in-
convenience others, as he rushes headlong into the greatest
danger himself. But we are not ignorant of Satan's devices:
and how prompt is his wicked inclination to disturb the tran-
quillity of the church, how adapted is his wicked counsel to
the most flagitious actions, how he has his ministers ready
prepared to do his bidding with carefulness and cunning, there

Shepherd, J esus Ohrist3 and when the machinations of the
wolf are laid open and detected, he must be driven away by the
staff of the shepherds and the barking of the dogs; the stupid
herd must be snatched away from the claws of the lion, be-
fore they are torn in pieces by his teeth, and, if possible,
brought back into the fold. In this respect, however, (as far
as I can understand from your letter,) you have left nothing
untried: you have exerted all your care and diligence in pre*-
serving that mischievous Bonamy¹ 3 and, which is the duty of

into popery. In the county of Southampton, (says Sti-ype, Ann. 11. ii.

priests from abi-ead) were many of these papists, and so multiplied by
revolting from religion, ‘that thc Bishop of winchester, in whose diocese
