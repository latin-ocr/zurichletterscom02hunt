LETTER CXXXI.

LAURENCE HUMPHREY TO RODOLPH GUALTER.
Dated at Oxronn, Any. 11, 1578.

IMMANURL. Ι recognise in your letter, most learned Gual-
ter, express manifestatione of your wonted kindness and
discretion. For I regard it as a proof of the greatest kind-
neSS‚ united to peculial· condescension‚ that you were inclined
to addi-ess one who had been so long silent, and almost un-

that they will fully make good both to you and the senate.
Since therefore I feel assured that the result will make this
manifest to you, Ι cannot but recommend to you these young
men of such excellent hope. I wrote to the bishop of W in-
chester, who has already contributed somewhat, and promises
also that he will take charge of them from this time. Your
intelligence of the death of P. M. and our other fathers, and
of your son³‚ formerly my pupil, is indeed most painful and
