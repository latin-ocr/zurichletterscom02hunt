distressingg on my own account, individually, who deservedly
regarded and loved them; publickly, for the church's sake,
for whom it is so grievous and lamentable to be continually
losing everywhere so many of 1101· brightest ornaments. You,
however, most reverend father, are a host in yourself, and l]
therefore entreat you to continue to benefit the christian com-
monwealth by your learned and pious lucubrations3 so that
the meditatione of your old age, like the song of the swan,
may delight us again and again. How severe 15 this loss of
our most excellent men, England has long known to her eost,
nor ean she, I think, ever foi-get, and certainly ought not to

the Tridentine fathers enforeing that bloody decree of theirs,
and our daily sins deserviug the execution of it.

The news is now reported in Flanders, that [duke] Oasimir⁷
is lingering still in Guelderland, and 15 laying siege to Deventer,
and that 110 shortly intends to unite his forces with our troops ;
that the Austrian [Don John] is fortifying himself within the
city, with ditches and trenches and walls; that 011 the first
of August he sent forth 1115 light troops against the English,
French, and Scots; that there was sharp fighting on both
sides from eight o'elock till five 111 the eveniug, that two 111111-
