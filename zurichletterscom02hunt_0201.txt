LETTER CXXXIV.

ARCHBISHOP SANDYS TO RODOLPH GUALTER.

Dated at London, Dec. 0, 1579.

AT one and almost the same moment, most learned and,
on so many accounts, most honoured sir, I received two letters
from you; and almost two years after they were sent, through
a mistake, I suppose, in the address. For they were directed
to the bishop of London, though three years have elapsed
since my translation to the archbishoprick of York; so that
your letters, secking me in London, were later in reaching
these northern parts of the kingdom. Now, however, as Ι
am desimus of replying to your letters, these are 1119 points
more especially on which I wish you to be satisfied; that Ι
keep in remembrancc your regard for me, and that I still
firmly remain your friend and faithful brother.

It does not escape my observation, that we 1119 arrived
at such a state of the times as is daily bringing forth some
novelty or other: I should commit to paper such as are most
fitting for you to be acquainted with, were it not that through
the unhappiness of this age I have seen many things soberly
written and piously conceived, partly from being lost, and
partly from being intercepted, occasion very great danger to
those who wrote them. That I may 1101, however, (19911119
