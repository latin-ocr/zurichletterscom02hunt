papist malcontents, who are plotting against both their lives
and fortunes, have reeently suffered a most severe loss, and
are thought to be not far from the total loss of all their
influenee in those parts.

As a testimony and token of my regard for you, my very
dear friend, I was exeeedingly desimus of sending you some
of our wares, if any merchant would be willing to export
them. But as I could find no one bold enough to undertake
the risk, (as these times are so suri-ounded with danger on all
sides,) I hope that you will take in good part this lone and
naked letter. And so, wishing you no less happiness than
myself, now living in London, and waiting sor the opening
of parliament on the 20th of J anuary, 1 desire for you and all

your friends health in Christ. London, in England, December
9, 1579.

Your brother in Christ, and most loving friend,

EDWIN SANDYS, Ebor.
