this alone consists both the most powersul safeguard of our
enemies and redoubtableness of their arms, and also the
strongest bulwark and impregnable 10111055 of every just de-
fence. And forasmuch as this alone is the only key to so
much power on either side; and as those who suffer themselves
to be overcome by the lust of empire, exert their entire ener-
gies to this object3 it is necessary for you 10 110 011 your
guard, who have now 101· 50 many years, by the blessing of this
union, been in the enjoyment of that liberty which your fore-
fathers conquered 101 you by their valour, and which these
haughty despots envy you beyond measure. lf you would
enjoy this in perpetuity, and transmit it as an inheritance

Greece, so it is to bc feared that the Genevese, when sub-
jugated by the Spanish Savoyard, shall provo in like sort
the 1011015 of your whole 00111011011110 nation. Compare only
the nature 01 1110 country, the spirit and daring of the enemy,
his very power unwieldy through its excess, with your own
narrow resources3 and judgo whether it be 0101111110, that he
