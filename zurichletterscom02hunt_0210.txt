336 QUEEN Etimnnru To THE TninTEEN οΑΝΤΟΝε, 830.

long as your own ancient rights, and laws, and liberty remain
111131111νο1τθᾶὲ Which in proportion as it would be a more
dreadful spectacle to yourselves, and a more painful one to us,
we again and again advise and entreat you to be forearmed
and on your guard, lest such an event should occul-3 so that,
mutually congratulating yourselves 011 the preservation of your
ancient dignity and independence, you may be a comfort to
your friends, a protection to your neighbours, and an ever-
lasting benefit to posterity. Ourself, though a woman, has
taken the lead in this contest, presel-ring as we do to our own
ease, dignity, kingly possessions, to whatever in short we hold
or can hold most dear, the liberty of the neighbouring nations,
and the preserving in their integrity the just rights and authority
of others. We are placed and appointed of God for this very
purpose, that as far as lieth in us we should do violence to none,
but avert it from all, as being well aware, that he who, having
the ability, useth it not for another's help, is as much to blame
as though he were that othei-“s destroyer.

But you of your prudence know these things right well; and
of your friendly inclination, good will, and pious zeal towards
each other, are sufficiently ready to succour the oppressed, as
to make due provision for your own safety. XVherefore we
forbear adding more, save only that, for the sake of the
piety which you exhibit towards God and man, we commend
to you and to your good saith the battercd remnant of your
severely besieged countrymen: and may the God of salvation
evei-more bless and prosper you!

Given at our court at Greenwich, the 18th of July, in

the year of our Lord 1590, and in the thirty-second year of
our reign.

ELIZABETH R.
