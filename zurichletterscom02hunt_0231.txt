LETTER 1¹.

 

PETER MARTYR TO BISHOP JEWEL.

Dated at Zumcn, Any. 24, 1562.

ΒΥ the favour of the bishop of London, most worthy
preLate, and my ever honoured lord, was brought hither a
copy of your Apology for the church of England‚ the which
had not been seen before either by myself or any of our people.
In your last letter indeed you rather gave an intimation of
its intended appearance, than an express announcement of
it. But so long was the journey hither‚ that it could not
reach us till about the first of August3 whereby you may
figure to yourself how much loss we are continually sustaining
on account of the distance of places. As for the Apology‚
it hath not only in all points and respects satisfied me, (by
whom all your writings are so wonder-fully well liked and ap-
proved) but it appeared also to Bullinger, and his sons and
sons-in-law‚ and also to Gualter and &Volfius‚ so wise, admi-
rable, and eloquent, that they can make no end of commend-
ing it, and think that nothing in these days hath been set
forth more perfectly. Ι exceedingly congratulate your talents
upon this excellent fruit, the church upon this edifying of it,
and England upon this honour3 and beseech you to proceed
in the same way you have entered. For though we have
a good cause, yet in comptu-ison of the number of our ene-
mies there are but few who defend it; and they now seem so
awakened‚ that by their goodness of style and erasty sophisms
they much recommend themselves to the unlearned multi-
tude. I speak of the Stapl1ili²‚ Hosii³‚ and most other writers
