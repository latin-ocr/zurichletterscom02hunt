of the same stamp, who are at this time shewing themselves
strenuous patrous of the pope's lies. Wherefore, since you
have excited so great expectations of yourself in your most
learned and elegant Apology, know for certain, that all good
and learned men are assuring themselves that, while you are
alive, the truth of the gospel will not be attacked by its ene·-
mies with impunity. And I rejoice most exceedingly, that
I have seen the day in which you are made the parent of
so noble and elegant an offspring. May God our heavenly
Father grant of his goodness, that you may often be honoured
with the like fruit!

As to other things that you are doing yonder, I am as
ignorant as a Parthian or Indian is of the affairs of Germany.
But I persuade myself that your affairs are in a fiourishing‚
or at least in a tolerable condition, because we know from ex·

am not so strong and lusty as I was heretofore. For the
burden of old age daily becomes more heavy. Now, for the
space of a year and a half, I have been altogether toothless,
neither hath my stomach performed its office of exciting me
to eat with an appetite. I am troubled also with rheum·;
in addition to which I have no small pain in my legs, by
reason of two sores wherewith I am at times greatly tor-
mented. Wherein though the body properly and by itself
be affiicted, yet by reason of that connection between them
which the Greeks call sympathy, the mind also cannot choose
but be affected.

These things, which Ι am sure for the good will you bear
me you will be sorry to hear, I would by no means have
