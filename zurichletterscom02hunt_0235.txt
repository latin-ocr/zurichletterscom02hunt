1.] Persa ΜΑιιίὙη To Bisflor fflwffl„ 341

inserted in this letter, had I not very great need of your
prayers, which I have persuaded myself l shall obtain to be
more earnest, because of the necessity wherewith Ι arn urged.

Respecting the French affairs I write nothing, as I feel
assured that they are no less known to you than to inyself.
The Tridentine synod is feigning to make progress; but it
advances so slowly‚ that in these five sessions it hath decided
nothing to the purpose. Its definitions are old and mouldy, so
that they seem not to act the part of fathers, but of beetles, who
are always turning over the sels-same ordure of traditions.

Farewell, most accomplished melate, and more than the
half of my own soul. May God very long preserve, keep,
and increase you with every good, both for the church and
eommonwealth! All friends and learned men salute you.

LETTER ¹11.

 

HENRY BULLlNGER TO BISHOP HORN ¹.
Dated at Zuuoen, Nov. 3, 1565.

W nm* you write, reverend father in Christ, touching the
controversy which has arisen among you concerning the
vestments of the clei-gy, Ι had previously learned from the
letter of our common friend, John Abel, to which Ῑ have
lately replied. It grieved me exeeedingly, as it still eon-
tinues to do, that this occasion is afforded to our adversaries
by the mutual dissensions of those among you who preach
the purer doctrine of the truth. As however l am most
probably unacquainted with all the circumstances, Ι hesitate
to pronounco any opinion upon the subject. But, that Ῑ
may not soem wanting in my duty, when required by yourself
and other friends to declaro my sentiments, Ι will here re-
peat what Ι have lately stated in my letter to Abel.
