I approve the zea-l of those persons who would have the
church purged from all the dregs of popery3 for I am aware
of that passage of the prophet, where God warns us to put
away [her] whoredoms out of [her] sight, and [her adulteries]
from [between her] breasts. [Hos. ii. 2.] On the other
hand, I also commend your prudence, who do not think
that churches are to be foi-saken because of the vestments
[of the clergy]. For since the great end of the ministry
is the edification and preservation of the church, we have
need of great circumspection, lest we should depart from this,
even while we are defending a cause, which in itself is good
and holy. Nor are we only to consider what is now the
state of that church which we think of forsaking, but also
what it will be when we have left it. If it be certain that it
will improve, we are at liberty to depart3 but if, on the
contrary, it will suffer loss, we are not to give place to wicked
and treacherous workinen. But, as far as I can form an
opinion, your common adversaries are only aiming at this,
that on your removal they may put in your places either
papists, or else Lutheran doctors and presidents, who are not
very much unlike them. Should this come to pass, not only
will all ecclesiastical order be disturbed, and the number of
most absurd ceremonies be increased, but even images (which
we know are defended by the Lutherans) will be restored;
the artolatry1 in the Lord's supper will be reintroduced3 private
absolution, and after this, auricular confession will creep in
by degi-cest, and an infinite number 'of other evils will arise,
which will both occasion confusion in general, and also bring
into danger many godly individuals. For I doubt not but
that you have met with so much success in your ministry,
as that you have very many throughout the whole kingdom,
both nobility, citizens, husbandmen, men, in short, of every
rank and class in society, who are most favourably disposed
to religion, and who abhor all doctrine that may open the
door to superstition and idolatry; and who would feel it
intolerable that a tyranny should again be set up in the
church, to burden the consciences of the unhappy people.
These, if you depart from the helin of the church, will most
assuredly be subjected to the rage of their adversaries, who
will establish exa-minations and inquisitions against them, as
