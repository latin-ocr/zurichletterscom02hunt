well public as private ς will accuse them of heresy and sedition,
and through them will render the whole cause of religion
'suspected and hateful, both to her most serene majesty, and
all the nobility of the realm. We must therefore cai-efully
guard against their wicked artifices, lest we should yield to
them of our own accord what they have now for many years
endeavoured to obtain with much labour and diligence.

But if any one should ask me whether I approve of those
who first enacted, or are now zealous maintainers of, those
laws by which the dregs of popery are retained, Ι eandidly
and freely answer that I do not approve of them. For they
are either acting too imprudently, if they are on our side;
or else they are treacherously laying snares for the liberty
of the churehes. But although they have obtruded upon you
these dregs, as if they were necessary for the worship of God,
for a safe conscience, and the salvation of the soul, I should
think that every thing ought rather to be submitted to, than
that you should suffer a godly people to be led away by
them from a pure profession of saith. And since it is ex-

you are at liberty, if I am not mistaken, to assign a reason
for what you do, to remove any opinion of superstition from
every one's mind, and to make a protest that may take
away all ground of offenee. In the meanwhile, let the most
serene queen and the illustrious nobles of the realm be in-
structed, urged and pressed, no longer to stain and defile
a reformation, effected with so much praise and with the
admiration of the whole world, with dregs and filthiness of
this kind, nor to give occasion to the neighbouring churehes
of Scotland and France for any suspicion of disunion.

I am aware that many questions are raised by some
parties respecting the authority of kings and magistrates,
whether they ought to make any law-s for the church, and
whether the clei-gy are bound to obey such laws. But Ι
do not consider these inquiries of so much consequence in
the present case, since, as I have above stated, all eoneeit
of superstition is removed by the words of the proclamation
itself. And we must take care, lest, by raising questions
