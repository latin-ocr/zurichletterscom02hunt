before the people respecting the extent of magisterial autho-
rity, we should give occasion to some disorderS. These things,
however, ought to be lawfully discussed in the public assembly
of the realm; and those, who from their situation have it
in their power to remind the queen and the nobles of their
duty in private, ought by no means to be wanting in their
endeavours.

I have now stated, reverend father in Christ, what I had
to write at this present time, because you were desirous of
hearing my sentiments on the question before us. I would
by no means burden any man's conscience3 but nevertheless
Ι think that we ought to beware, lest, while we are con-
sulting our own feelings and reputation as individuals, we
should bring the church at large into some grievous peril.
And Ι do not think this opinion of mine is at variance with
the mind of Paul, who was wont to become alc thinys 250
all meu, that he miyht {jain soma· and who thought good
to circumcise Timothy, lest he should alienate the Jews of
that place from the christian religion, and that he might
exercise his ministry with greater advantage3 but who, on
other occasions, thought it not fit to yield in the least to
those who placed any merit in circumcision itself. But as
many as have made the edification of the church the scope
and end of their designs and actions, have not erred in con-
troversies of this kind.

I have nothing to write about our own affairs. The Lord
so regarded us during the pestilence of the last year, that
we did not lose a single minister.l One or two died in the
country. The plague, indeed, now seems to be skirmishing
in some degree in our city, but is not likely to be violent. W'e
are in the Lord's hands, let his will be done. On the 20th of
November there will be a congress of the princes electors
at W ornis, in which a consultation will be had concerning
the restoration of peace in Germany, and some points of great
importance will be discussed respecting the bishops and their
reformation. May the great and good God direct by his
Spirit the minds and counsels of all parties to his glory
and the safety of the church! My wife desires her most
respectful salutations to the honourable lady, your wife. Fare-
wcll, reverend father in Christ. Zurich, Nov. 3, 1565.
