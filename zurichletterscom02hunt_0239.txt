LETTER III.

HENRY BULLINGER To LAURENCE HUMPHREY AND
'rHOMAs SAMPSON.

Dated at Zmucn, stlay l, 1566.

Mus the Lord J esus bless you, most accomplished sirs,
and very dear brethren, and preserve you from all evil!

I have received your letters-2, from whieh I learn, Laurence,
that you complain that my reply to your question appears
too concise. But, my brother, I neither perceived at that
time, nor do Ι now perceive, the necessity of writing more
copiously. For you only inquired what was my opinion with
respect to the vestiarian controversy now agitated in England.
To this question I thought it best to give you a short answer;
for I could express my sentiinents in few words. Besides,
Ι was aware that master Peter Martyr, of blessed memory,
had both here and at Oxford frequently and fully handled
the same question, and I had nothing to add to his remarks,
But I remember, that in my letter addressed to you, my
brother Sampson, I also gave a statement of my own opinion.
And to repeat my sentiments in few words, Ι could never
approve of your officiating, if so commanded, at an altar
laden, rather than adorned, with the image of him that was
crucified, and in the appropriate dress of the mass, that is,
in the alb and eope, on the back part of which also the
same image is represented. But, as far as I can understand by
a letter from England, there is now no dispute concerning
habits of this kind; but the question is, whether it be lawful
for the ministers of the gospel to wear a round or square
cap, and a white garment which they call a snrpliee, by
the wearing of which the minister may be distinguished from
the people! And, whether it be a duty rather to relinquish
the ministry, or sacred office, than to wear vestments of this
kind} I replied to this question at the last fair. in a letter to
the reverend master doctor Robert Horn, bishop of Win-
chester, and briefly repeated the words of master Martyr.
