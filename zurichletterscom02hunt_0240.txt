346 APPENDIX. [LET.

My colleague and very dear relative, master Rodolph Gualter,
had written to the same person a short time before; a copy
of which letter I send to yourself and our other brethren,
inclosed in this. If, therefore, you are disposed to listen to
us, and desire our opinion respecting the vestiar-ian contro-
versy, as 'you signified to me in your last letter, behold!
you possess our opinion in this epistle: in which if you
are unable to acquiesce, we are indeed most exeeedingly
grieved; and since we have no other advice to offer, we
heartily and continually pray the Lord, who is under all
circumstances and at all times to be looked up to, that by
his grace and power he may provide a remedy for this
afflictive state of things.

Some questions, my brother Laurence, have been proposed
by yourself, but our brother Sampson has framed a greater
number upon the same subject. But although in my homely
simplicity Ι could never approve of the subject being divided
into so many questions, and entangled in such complicated
knots, which otherwise, simple in itself, might be stated with
sufficient perspicuity in few words3 yet I will remark some-
what upon each question, that in this matter also I may
be of service to yon, my honoured masters and very dear
brethren, as far as my lack of utteranee, and power of per-
ception rather blunted than sharpened, will permit me. And
I entreat you to receive with kindness these remarks from
me, your brother, and who love you so much; and to judge
respecting them with a mind calm and free from prejudice.
I altogether abominate all controversy, and I implore nothing
more suppliantly from the Lord, than that he may take away
from the church those contentions which from the beginning,
and at all times, have been most injurious to true piety,
and torn the church, however peaceful and flourishing, in
pleces.

1. To the question, whether laws respecting] habits ouylct
to be prescribed to ecclesiastics, that theg( may be distiizgyu‘z'slaed
bys them from tlce laity, I reply, that there is an ambiguity
in the word oufylct. For if it is taken as implying what is
necessary aud appertaining to salvation, Ι do not think that
even the authors of the laws themselves intend such an
interpretation. But if it is asserted, that for the sake of
