decency, and comeliness of appearance, or dignity and order,
some such regulation may be made, or some such thing be
understood, as that which the apostle requires, namely, that a
bishop or minister of the church should be κόσμιος, (Ι mean
decent or orderly‚) Ι do not see how he is to blame, who
either adopts a habit of this sort himself, or who commands
it to be worn by others.

2. Wlaether tlce ceremonial worship ⁰f the Leviticalpriest-
hood is to be reintroduced into the claurcla? Ι reply, if a.
cap and habit not unbecoming a minister, and free from super-
stition, are commanded to be used by the clergy, no one
can reasonably assert that J udaism is revived. Moreover,
I will here repeat the answer that I see doctor Martyr made
to this question, who, after having shewed that the sacraments
of the old law had been abolished, and ought not to be
reintroduced into the church of Christ, which has [those of]
baptism and the Lord's supper, subjoined, “there were not-
withstanding in the Levitical law some ordinances of such
a character, as that they cannot properly be called sacraments;
for they served unto decency and order, and a certain be-
eomingness, which, as agreeable to the light of nature, and
furthering some utility of ours, I judge, may not only be
restored but retained. Who seeth not that the apostles
for quietness sake, and for the better living together of be-
lievers, commanded the gentiles to abstain from things stran-
gled and from blood? These things were beyond dispute
legal and Levitical. Also, no man is ignorant that at this
day tithes are instituted in many places for the support of
ministers. It is most evident too, that psalms and hymns
are sung in the holy assemblies‚ which nevertheless the
Levites also practised. And, not to omit this, we have feast
days in reniembrance of our Lord⁹s resurrection, and other
things. Are all these things to be abolished because they
are traces of the old law ’Ξ You see then, that all the
Levitical rite-s are not to be so abrogated, as that none of
them may be lawfully retained.'' Thus far Peter Martyr¹.
