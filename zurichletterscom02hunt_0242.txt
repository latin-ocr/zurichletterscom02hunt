3. l‘Vhether is it atlowable to have a habit in common
with papists? I answer, it is not yet proved that the pope
introduced a distinction of habits into the churchg so far from
it, that it is clear that such distinction is long anterior to
popery. Nor do I see why it should be unlawful to use, in
common with papists, a vestment not superstitious, but per-
taining to civil regulation and good order. If it were not
allowable to have any thing in common with them, it would be
necessary to desert all the churches, to decline the receipt
of stipend, to abstain from baptism, and the reciting of the
apostles' and the Nicene creed, and even to reject the Lord's
prayer. But after all, you do not borrow any, eeremonies
from them, for the use of the habits was never set aside
from the beginning of the reformation, and it is still retained,
not by any popish enactment, but by virtue of the royal
edict, as a matter of indifferenee and of civil order.

4. The use¹ therefore of a distinetive cap or habit in
eivil matters savem-3 neither of Jmlaism πον φηοηασῖιὶωης for
they affect to appear separated from civil life, and make a
merit of their peculiar dress. T hus Eustathius, bishop of
Sebastia2, was condemned, not merely on account of his pecu-
liar dress, but because he made religion to consist in that
dress. The canons of the eouncils of Gangra, Laodicea, and
the sixth synod are known. And if some of the people are
led to believe that this savours of popery, -Judaism, and mona-
chism, let them be admonished and rightly instructed in these
matters. And should any be disquieted by the importunate
clamours of some individuals, lavishly poured forth upon this
subject among the people, let those who act thus have a
care, lest they should impose heavier burdens upon themselves,
iri-itate the queen’s majesty, and end by bringing many faithful
ministers into dangers from which they will hardly escape.

[² Du Pin states that the Eustathius whose errors were condemned
at the eoum-il of Gangra, was a different person from the bishop of
Sebastia. See above p. 159, note 2.]
