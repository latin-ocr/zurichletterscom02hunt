ancl tlte elwrde, I reply, that in my opinion great cantion
is to be observed lest this disputo, and clamour, and contention
respecting the habits should be conducted with too much
bitterness, and by this importunity a handle should be afforded
to the queen's majesty to leave that no longer a matter of choice
to those who have abused their liberty; but being irritated by
these needless clamours, she may issue her orders, that either
these habits must be adopted, or the ministry relinquished.
It appears indeed most extraordinary to me, (if l may be
allowed, most accomplished and very dear brethren, to speak
my sentiments without offence,) that you can persuade your-
selves that you cannot, with a sase conscience, subject your-
selves and churches to vestiariam b011dag03 and that you do
not rather consider, to what kind of bondage you will sub-
Ject yourselves and churches, if you refuso to comply with a
civil ordinance, which is a matter of indifference, and are
perpetually contending in this troublesome way, because,
by the relinquishment of your office, you will expose the
churches to wolves, or at least to teachers who are far from
competent, and who are not equally fitted with yourselves
for the instruction of the people. And can you be said to
have asserted the liberty of the churehes, who minister occa-
sion of oppressing the church with burdens even yet more
grievous? Are you not aware of what is the object of many,
in what manner they are affected towards the preaching of
the gospel, of what character will be those who are to succeed
you, and what is to be expected from them?

6. Wlaethar the dress of the cler-agl is a matter qs in-
different-e :9 It certainly seems such, when it is a matter of
civil ordinance, and has respect only to decency and order,
in which things religious worship does not consist.

Thus, my most learned and dearly beloved brother, Lau-
rence, have l thought fit briefly to reply to your letter. I
now come also to the questions of our friend master Sampson,
in the discussion of which I shall probably be yet inore brief.
