history of Theodoret, Book 11. chap. 27, and of Socrates,
Book v1. chap. 22¹. And no one who has but cursorily con-
sidered the monuments of antiquity‚ can be ignorant that the
ministers always wore the pallium upon sacred occasions; so
that, as I have before intimated, the distinction of habits does
not derive its origin from the pope. Eusebius truly bears
witness from the most ancient writers, that the apostle John at
Ephesus wore on his forehead a petalzmffl, or pontifical plate
[of gold]; and Pontius³, the deacon, relates of the martyr
Cyprian, that when he was about to present his neck to
the executioner, he first gave him his birrusn and his dalmatio⁵

[l The following is the story to which Bullinger refers. Sisinius,
the Novatian bishop, going one day to visit Ars-acius, bishop of Con-
stantinople, one of 1110 clergy asked him why he wore a gal-ment which
did not become a bishop‘Z and, where it was written that a priest ought
to be clothed in white? To whom 110 replied, You first shew me where
it is written, that a bishop ought to 110 010111οᾶ 111 111301ἰῖ See Bing-

[2 The petalam was the name given to the 111111 plata of gold which
the Jewish high priest wore on his forehead. See above, p. 160, note 1.]

[⁴ The birrus, says Mr Bingham, was 1101 peculiar to bishops, nor
yet to the clcrgy, and was no more than the common tunica or 0031
worn generally by Christians in Africa, as may appear from a canon
of the council of Gangra, made. against Eustathius the 11010110 and his
followers, who condemned the common habit, the birrus, and brought in
the use of a strange habit in its room. The canon runs in these words:
Εἴ τις ἀνδρῶν Eat? νομιζομένην ἄσκησιν ’περιβολαίῳ χρῆται, καὶ αἶς·
ἄν ἐκ ’τούτου τήν δικαιοσύνην ἔχων καταψηφίσωιτο ’τῶν μετ’ εὐλα-
βεῖας τούς βήρους φορούντων, καὶ ’τῇ ἄλλῃ κοινῇ καὶ ἐν συνηθείᾳ
οὔσῃ ἐσθῆτι κεχρημένων, ἀνάθεμα ’ἑο-τω. If any man uses the pal⁴
lium, or clokc, upon the account of an ascetic life, and, as if there were
some holiness in that, condemns those that with reverence use the
birrus and other gal-ments that are commonly worn, let him be ana-
thema, Bingham, as above, ἓ. 19. See above, p. 159, note 3.]

[⁵ There were two kinds of tunica, 1110 dalmatica and collobium,
the latter being a short coat without long sleeves 3 whereas the dalma-
tica was the tunica manicata et talaris, a long coat with slceves down to
the wrists. This was seldom in use among the Romans; for Lampri-
dius notes it as a singular thing in the life of the emperor Commodus,
that dalmatic-attus· in publico processit, he wore a dalmatica in public.
This, Mr Bingham thinks, is a good argument to prove that the clei-gy
of this age did not wear the dalmatica in public, 511100 11 was not then
the common gai-ment of the Romans. And 110 approves of the con-
