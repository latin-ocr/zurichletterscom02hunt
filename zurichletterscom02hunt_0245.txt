they exchanged the logya for the pallium, on which account
when they were ridiculed by unbelievcrs, Tertullian⁶ composed
his most learned treatise (Ze pallio. I could produce many
other instances of the same kind, did not these suffice. I
should prefer indeed, that no difficulties had been thrown in
the way of the clei-gy, and that they might have been at
liberty to follow the practice of the apostles. But since

the deacon, (given above p. 160, note 2,) for the words tunicam tulit,
some officious modern transcribers changed the word tunicam into
dalmaeicmn (as Bullinger appears to have read it), as being more agree-
able to the languagc and custom of their own time, when the dalma-
tica was reckoned among the sacred vestinents of the church, though
we never find it mentioned as such in any ancient author. Bingham,
