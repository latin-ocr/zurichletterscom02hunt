as necessary, and thus made a matter of religion. In fact,
the times and places of religious assemblies are assuredly

prescription in such cases, consider, Ῑ pray, what confusion
and disorder would ensue‘?

of a superstitious character, and also that in their very nature
they are matters of indifference.

remarked touching the Levitical rites. But I should be loth
that any idolatrous rites should. be transferred to the reformed
churches, without being purified from what is amiss in them,
But it might also be demanded on the other hand, whether
established ceremonies, void of superstition, may not be re-
tained in the church without any impropriety, for the sake of
discipline aud order.
