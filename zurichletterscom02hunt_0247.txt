’7. Wlaetlm· consor-mito must of necessity he required in
ceremonies .9 I reply, that conformity in cel-emonies is perhaps
not necessary in every chureh. Meantime however, if a thing
is commanded, which, though not necessary, is on the other
hand not sinful3 the clun-ch, it seems to me, ought not on
this account to be relinquished. There was not conformity in
rites in all the more ancient churehes; those, however, which
adopted rites in conformity with each other, did not censure
those who wanted sueh conformity1. And l ean easily believe
that wise and politic men are urgent for a conformity of ritos,
because they think it will tend to concord, and that there may
be one and the same church throughout all England ; wherein,
provided nothing sinful is intermixed, I do not see why you
should oppose yourselves with hostility to harmless regulations
of that kind.

eoiclent offence? I answer, that we ought to avoid offence3
but we must take care in the mean time, lest we cloke our
own feelings under the pretext of offenee. You are not igno-
rant that one thing is given, and another thing received,
and that offence is readily taken. I am not now inquiring
whether you can, without grievous offence, desert, for a thing
in itself indifferent, those churehes sor which Christ died.

constitutions which the queen's majesty wishes to impose
upon you, are free from any impiety, they are rather to be
tolerated than that the ehurehes should be deserted. For
if the edifying of the church is the chief thing to be regarded
in this matter, we shall do the ehurch a greater injury by
deserting it than by wearing the habits. And where there
is no impiety, and the conscience is not wounded, it is proper
to submit, even if some degree of bondage be imposed. In
the mean time, however, it might be demanded on the other
hand, whether the imposition of the habits, as far as it tends to
