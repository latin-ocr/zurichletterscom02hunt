decency and order, may justly come under the denomination
of bondage?

10. lslcez‘loer may tleingy of a ceremonicd nature mags be
prescribecl to me clamet by the soz-ereigm, without the consent and
free concurrenee of the clergyy? I answer, -if the consent of
the elorgy is always to be waited for by the sovereign, it
is probable that those most wise and pious kings, Asa, Heze-
kiah, Jehoshaphat, and J osiah, and other godly princes, would
never have brought into proper order the Levites and ministers
of the churches. Though I would not altogether have the
bishops excluded from the consultations of churchmen. But
on the other hand, Ι would not have them assume to them-
selves that power, which they heretofore usui-ped over kings
and magistrates in the time of popery. Nor again, would
I have the bishops sanction by their silence the unjust
ordinances of princes.

11, 12. The last two questions come more closely to¹
the point. lVlcether it is more expedient z‘lms to obegs tlte

is no superstition, no impiety, but yet they are imposed
upon godly pastors, who would rather that they should ⁴not
be imposecl upon them, Ι will certainly allow, and that most
fully, that a burden and bondage is imposed upon then1;
but Ι will not allow, and this for most just reasons, that their
station or ministry is on that account to be deserted, and
place given to wolves, as was before observed, or to ministers
less qualified than themselves: especially, since there re-
mains the liberty of preaching, and care may be taken that
no greater bondage shall be imposed 3 with many other things
of this kind, ὥσ.

Ι have now stated what it seemed to me might be said
upon the proposed questions, being well aware that others, in
proportion to their erudition, might have discussed the subject
with far greater elegance and effect; but since it was your
wish that I myself should answer them, I have done what
Ι could, leaving both a free pen and an unfettered opinion
upon these matters to others. As ‘to what remains, I wish
