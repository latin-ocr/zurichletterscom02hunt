not to force and entangle the conscience of any one by
what I have written, but merely propose it for consideration;
and I would have you bcware, lest any one in this present
controversy should conceal a contentious spirit under the
name of conscience. And I also exhort you all, by Jesus
Christ our Lord, the Saviour, head, and king of his church,
that every one of you should duly consider with himself,
whether he will not more edify the church of Christ by
regarding the use of habits for the sake of order ancl decency,
as a matter of indifference, and which hitherto has tended
somewhat to the harmony and advantage of the cliui-0113 than
by leaving the church, on account of the vestiarian controversy,
to be occupied hereafter, if not by evident wolves, at least
by ill-qualified and evil minister-s. May the Lord J esus give
you to see, to understand, and to follow what makes for
his glory, and the peace and safety of the church!

Farewell in the Lord, together with all faithful ministers.
We will earnestly pray the Lord for you, that you may both
perceive and do what is holy and beneficial. Master Gualter
salutes you most affectionately, and prays for you every happi—
ness. We too, the other ministers, do the same. Zurich,
May 1, 1566.

HENRY BULLINGER,

minister of the church of Zurich,

in his own name and that of GUALTER.

P. S. I would advise you, my dear Sampson, not to pub-
lish any thing of master Bibliander's3 as the papers in your
possession are mere collections from his hearers, and not written
hy Bibliander himself. For his executors are in possession of
his commentaries, his manuscript notes on the Bible, or on

the old Testament3 and they would be very angry if any ·

thing were to be. published under his name, which he himself
had not written. Meanwhile, I have to thank your kindness
sor acquainting mc with these things. But your letter, written
on the thh of February, was only delivered to me 011 the
26th of April.
