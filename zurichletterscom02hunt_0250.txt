HENRY BULLINGER TO BISHOPS HORN, GRINDAL,
AND PARKHVURST.

Dated at Znnlcn, Ilsay 3, 1566.

REVEREND sirs, right honourable lords, and very dear
brethren. May the Lord J esus bless you, and preserve you
from all evil! We send our letter on the vestiarian contro-
versy, written by us to the learned men, and our honoured
godly brethren, N. and M. And we send it to you on this
account, that ye may understand that we would not have
any private communication with the brethren, without the
knowledge of you, the principal ministers3 and that in all
things we seek the peace of your churehes, according to
our power. We pray also the Lord, that he may always
direct your affairs, and preserve you in peace. We exhort
you, reverend sirs, and very dear brethren, to have respect
to faithful ministers and learned men. They have their own
feelings3 whence the apostle has instructed us to bear one cmo-
ther’s bardans. Your authority can effect much with her most
serene highness, the queen. Prevail upon her lnaJesty to
grant that these worthy brethren may be reconciled and
restored.

We entreat likewise that you, master Horn, our honoured
lord and very dear brother, to whom this letter will first
be presented, will forthwith take care that it may be forwarded
to the bishop of Norwich, and that you will communicate
it to masters J ewel, Sandys, and Pilkington3 to all of
whom, God willing, I will write at the next Frankfort fair.
I have written this in the greatest haste, both in my own
name and that of Gualter, and we send the letter to Basle
to be forwarded from thence to Antwerp. We earnestly
entreat you to let us know whether you have received it.
Far-ewell, reverend sirs, and may the Lord bless both you
and your labours! Zurich, May 3, 1566.

Yours,

BULLINGER.
