approvc of those articles, about which, when we wrote upon
the vestiarian controversy, we were altogether ignorant. The
sum of our judgment was this, that churches redeemed by
the blood of Christ ought on no account to be deserted for
the sake of caps and gowns, which are to be regarded as
mere matters of indifference‚ since they are enjoined to be
used, not with a view to any religious observance, but merely
as a matter of civil concern, for the maintenance of proper
decency. But we have now heard, though we hope the re-

scribe to some new articles, or to relinquish their office. And
the articles are said to be of this kind; that the measured
chanting¹ in churches is to be retained, and in a foreign
language, together with the sound of organs; and that in
cases of necessity women may and ought to baptize infants

in the receiving of the Lord's supper kneeling is necessary,
(which has an appearance of adoration,) and that the bread
is not to bc broken in common, but that a small morscl is
to be placed by the minister in the mouth of every commu—
nicant3 and that the mode of spiritual feeding, and of the
presence of the body of Christ in the holy supper, is not to
be explained, but to be left undetermined. It is stated more-

money, so now there are the same things for sale in the
court of the metropolitan3 namely, pluralities of livings, li-
cences for nou-residence, for eating meat on days forbidden
and during Lent, and the like, for which no permission is
granted without being paid for: that the wives too of the
clergy are removed apart from their husbands, (as if the
living together of man and wife were a thing impure,) just
as was formerly the practice among the priests of antichrist.
They say moreover, that no one is allowed to speak against
