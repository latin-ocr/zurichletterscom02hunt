any 01 111050 things either in public or privatc; and what is
more, that ministers, if they wish to continue the exorciso 01
111011 ministry in the 01111101105, aro under the necessity of
remaining silent under these grievances: so that all the
power 01 chureh government or authority rests solely with
the bishops, and no pastor is allowed to deliver his opinion
in ecclesiastical affairs of this kind.

If these things are true, they will indeed occasion ex-
ceeding grief not only to us, but to all godly persons. And
we pray the Lord 'to efface these blemishes from the holy
011111011 01 Christ which is 111 Englanth and to prevent any
of the bishops from dismissing from his office any pastor
who shall refuse either his assent 10, 01· approval 01, 111-110105
01 11115 kind. And although we entertain 1110 111051 entire
persuasion concerning your piety and simerity, 111111, 11 any of
these things are now in use, (101 we can scarcely believe that
things 50 gross exist among you‚) you are only tolerating and
conniving at them until the opportune assembling of the
great council of ⁴ the reahn, when fit and prudent measures
may be taken 101 1110 abolishing 01 superstiti0n; and if there
be any who pervert that letter 01 01115 for the purpose of
confirming any abuses, yet you yourselves arc not of 1110
number 01 511011 110150115; 110110111101055 110 exhort your reve-

other holy and prudent men touehing 1110 amendment and
purification of these aud similar superstitious, and faithfully
vindicate us from the injustice inflicted upon us by others.
For we have never approved those articles, as they have been
reported to us. We moreover entreat you o'f your courtesy
to receive in a spirit of kindness these remarks 01 oui-s, who
