and interminable discussion. W'lien Martyr, of blessed 1110-
mory, was still residing in England, he often wrote upon the
subject; but 50 many other questions have been suggested,
and repeated from time to time, that I pereeive it impos-
sible, by any thing that Ι can say or write, to satisfy your
minds. then we were applied to by you, we recommended
you, with all brotherly love, to adopt such a conduct as ap-
peared to 115, 111 1110 presence of the Lord, to be for the
advantage of the church. We stated that it seemed to us
of far greater importance that you should comply with these
habits for a time, and remain with the sheep committed to
your charge, than that you should leave them, and at the
same time desert the churches. We went no far-ther than
this; nor did we approve of any popish filthiness or super-
stition, respecting which indeed we did not enter into any
discussion, as we were entirely unacquainted with the mat-

write word, that the dispute has assumed a character of great
importance, and that the question is 110 longer merely about
a cap or a sul-plice, but that you have most grievous cause

Though indeed that letter of ours, written privately to
you respecting the vestiarian controversy, has been published
by some parties without our knowledge; yet we hope that
godly and prudent men will neither in convocation, nor out
of convocation, so distort our letter, as if we seeined now
to approve and desire the restoration of things that every
pious person, who is acquainted with 0111· writings, has long=
known us 10 disapprove of. We recommend you, as did
also master Martyr, both before 115 ancl in conjunction with
us, to aet as seemed to 115 both honourably and usefully in
the present emergency. Since we have hitherto failed to
convince you, we commit the whole matter to God, and
entreat you not to regard us with unkindness, but as friends,
as heretofore, continuing to love 115 who love you in the
Lord, whom we heartily pray, that he, who is the faithful
guardian of his 011111011, may eonipose this unhappy (115501151οη
that has arisen among you, and restore tranquillity to his
church. Relnembcr, brethren, we pray you by the Lord ‚J 05115,
that it is not only required of the ministers of the churehes
