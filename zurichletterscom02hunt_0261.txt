vu.] RODOLPH GUALTER TO BISHOP COX. 363

weal against any adversaries3 but free admonition is an evi-
dence of love, -by which is laid open the error of a brother
imposed upon by others, to the end that he may learn to
entertain a more correct opinion. And since you have exhi-
bited both these qualities with no less erudition than trudi,
Ι duly venerate your piety‚ and hope that the disagreement
which had arisen between us, will prove the occasion of an
indissoluble friendship. For I promise myself thus much
from your courtesy‚ that you will readily pardon this my
fault, when you consider at what time, from what innoves,
and to whom I wrote what I did. That time abeunded in
sore contentions‚ and letters on both sides were sent to us
almost every day, while that unhappy controversy about the
habits was agitated among you. W e then advised your adver-
saries not to stir up a contention in the church for a matter of
no importance, and we thought that the whole affair had
been laid at rest. But lo! contrary to all expectation, two
Englishmen² arrive at Geneva‚ bringing with them a letter
from master Beza, whose ears they had filled with calumnies
and false accusaffious, in which he entreated us to do our
endeavour to help the most afflicted state of England, and
further exhorted me to make a journey to you for that
purpose.

Το this was added the account of those two men, who
told us the same story that they had done at Geneva, and
that with so much assurance and affectation of piety, that
they set down in writing a great many errors and superstitious
'abuseS‚ which, as they asserted, were now maintained in
England; and that all such as would not consent thereunto
were cast out of their ministry. They added, that their most
grievous cause of complaint was this, namely, that most of
the bishops had become the willing executors of those things
which were daily eoined at court by superstitious and ambi-
tious courtiers.

Who would suspect that any persons could be so barefaeed.
