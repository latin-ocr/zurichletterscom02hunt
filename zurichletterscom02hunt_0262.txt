The account given by these men certainly troubled us not
a little; and I acknowledge, that on the impulse of the moment
I composed and sent that letter to master Parkhurst, with
whom I thought myself at liberty to act more freely on
account of our ancient friendship, which commenced five and
thirty years ago at Oxford, and was afterwards so confirmed
by his being entertained for four years at my house, that
I desire him to possess all influence with me, and I can
promise myself in return the same from him.

Nothing was further from my thoughts than that he would
publish my letter abroad. F or I rather desired to hear his
opinion, though indeed he had never written any thing upon
the subject. The thing which moved me not a little was,
that shortly after master Abel, a most worthy man, and a

we have certainly had nothing to do with those vain brawlers,
who neither at any time wrote to us, nor had it in their
power to boast of any letters from us,

their designs, when, under the pretence of ecclesiastical disci-
pline, (the principal part whereof they make to consist in
excommunication,) they were the chief authors of those changes
in the Palatinate, which have inflicted such a blow upon
the churches in that quarter. I once more, therefore, entreat
your excellence, reverend father in Christ, not to have any
sinister suspicion of Gualter, who bears a singular affection
to the English name, For Ι will take care, if the Lord
